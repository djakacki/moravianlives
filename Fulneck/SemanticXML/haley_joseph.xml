					The life of Joseph Haley who has left the following in writing
					I was born at Little Town in the Parish of Birstall in Yorkshire June 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					1727. My Parents were very poor &amp; belong&apos;d to the Church of England,
					but before I was 11 years old, I was bound Prentice for the Space of 10
					Years to a Broad Clothier, which I faithfully served in Hardshead Parish.
					In the middle of my time M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ingham &amp; Delamotte began to preach at
					Smith House &amp; Rawhead, where I often went to hear them &amp; got a lively
					Impression of the Friend of Sinners. But my Master being a Cross old
					Man, he would not let one go to hear the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, and as my time was
					almost out, I begd our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to keep me near his Person. My time
					being out I hired myself with another Master, who was a Methodist, when
					I became more Religious than before but could never get any Satisfaction
					&amp; my heart grew very dead &amp; cold. A the end of my Year I went to
					live at Hallifax to be an Hostler, there I plung&apos;d myself into all manner
					of wickedness. Soon after Iwent to live at Leeds where I was a
					Gentlemans Servant, here I became still more wicked &amp; miserable <hi rend="strikethrough">being</hi>
					<add place="margin">tho&apos; I was</add> always accused in my Mind &amp; knowing at the same time my Course was
					hurtfull to body &amp; Soul, so that my Life become burthensome to me.</p>
					<p>
					My Mother being a good old Methodist &amp; knowing of my going on
					She was much dissatisfied with me, &amp; often desired me to come
					home &amp; settle to my own Business, but I found it very difficult
					to leave my old wicked Companions, thinking I was fit for no
					other Company. Now my Confliction was broke &amp; I was befall&apos;n
					with a sore Sickness, which reduced me to great poverty &amp; being
					hardly fit for any thing, I then began to wish, that I could have
					called back the Time I had lost &amp; Spend without our Saviour.</p>
					<p>
					Having served in this place 4 Years and 5 Months I left my
					Master &amp; went to live with my Parents at High Town but

			<p>
					did not know what Course to take, for I was like a Spotted Bird
					even amongst the worldly People. I went again to hear the Methodists
					however here I could find no comfort &amp; my poor Heart felt always
					dissatisfied which made me resolved to go &amp; hear the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> but I always
					found Something to hinder me. Soon after it happened that I
					went to live with W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Taylor a Single Man of Cleckheaton who belongs
					to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. Hearing that there was a very pious Minister at White Chapple
					I went to hear his Sermons, but as he pre<add place="above">a</add>ched only the Law, I soon got
					a Dislike &amp; in the beginning of the Year 1757 I went to hear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyrleaus
					who preachd on these Words: Lord, save us, we perish, there my heart
					was laid so hold of that I shall never forget it. Having great uneasiness
					of Mind, I wished for an opportunity to speak with a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> which happened
					soon after to my great Satisfaction. I also got leave to come to the
					Classes of the Single Men &amp; in March <hi rend="strikethrough">the same Year</hi> <add place="above">1759</add> I was received into
					the Society, at which I felt our Savr very near to me. I beg&apos;d He might
					keep me close to Him. I being so exposed to the world made me think
					I should never come thro&apos;. I often came to Fulneck &amp; saw the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
					lived so happy together as I never saw People live before, I thought
					I could never be rightly happy unless I was there. Yet I could never
					offer to ask for it feeling my own Misery &amp; wickedness I thought they
					would never allow in to come there. In this way I continued like a
					Standing Water till <add place="above">March</add> 1760 when my Master W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Taylor got leave to move
					into the Choir House which caused me many Tears thinking our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had
					left me alone to myself on account of my unfaithfulness, what would become
					of me I did not know. As I was very uneasy &amp; being resolved to become our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> I desired leave to live in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Fulneck which I also obtain&apos;d
					&amp; moved thither Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 very glad &amp; thankfull. March 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1761 I was
					received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which was a great Blessing to me. In July I had
					a hard Sickness, in during which our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> gave me a new Seal of				
			</p>
			<p>
					my Grace Election &amp; comforted me about all past things. Decr 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761
					I was made a partaker of my Lords Corpse &amp; Blood in the holy Sacra-
					ment which was an unspeakable Grace to me, &amp; I esteemed this Year
					a Year of Blessings bestowed upon me, which I shall never be
					able to express, &amp; I wish that I may always have that Impression
					of it till our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> calls me home to himself. Oh! could I but
					always prize my Call &amp; Election sufficiently &amp; thank our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					that he has granted me a nest amongst his People I cannot but
					be ashamed that my heart does not burn more in Love towards Him.
					Thus far his own words.</p>
					<p>
					In the Year 1763 he got a Call to go to Bedford, of which he accepted
					in a Childlike manner &amp; served the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in Bedford as Cook for several
					Years &amp; then went to Duckenfield. On March 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1767 he came again
					to live here &amp; went on in a happy Course. In the beginning of June
					1770 he went to <add place="above">live in</add> the Oeconomy at Mirfield. He was Naturally
					a peevish Temper, but his plain Honest &amp; upright way of acting made
					him beloved amongst his B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He was free &amp; openhearted with his
					Labourer nor did he speak better of himself than it was. He often
					felt the oppression of his Sickly Tabernacle, especially in the Spring and
					Autumn, but this last Spring it soon appeared that his Sickness
					was a Consumption &amp; that he would not recover again on which
					account he wishd to come to Fulneck &amp; go home in the Choirhouse
					last
					here, which was also granted him, <add place="above">last</add> July the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for which he was
					very thankful. He spend his time in the Sick Room in a true Concession
					with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, waiting with resignation for the happy Hour of his Disso-
					lution which came to pass the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> took him happily
					to himself as a Sinner who had found Grace in His Death and
					Sufferings.
