					<p> serving, through the kind care of the lover of my soul, as a barrier, which
						prevented me from rushing into misery. <date when-iso="1734">In the year 1734</date> I was sent by my

						pursued me also here by his Grace in many ways. Being once in company with
						my french master, I accompanied him at night to his lodgings seemingly in
						good health. The next morning I was thunderstruck at hearing that he was
						dead, as my conscience forced immediatly this question upon me: what would
						have be come of you if this had been your case? I hastened to my room
						<name type="emotion">trembling, and throwing myself on the ground, and prayed</name> to an unknown <persName type="diety">God</persName>
						for Grace and conver sion of heart from sin. But sometime after I fell again

					</p>

					<p> at <placeName>Jena</placeName>, on which occasion I prayed to <persName type="diety">God</persName> with a concerned heart to
						preserve me from seduction and convert me. This prayer I repeated very often
						as I knew how hurtful bad the time was spent by the major part of the
						students, being afraid of falling into the same trade Soon after my arrival
						the late <roleName en="brother">brother</roleName> <persName>Daer baum</persName> went with me to the meetings of edification, held
						by the <roleName en="revrend">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></roleName> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<persName>Brumhards</persName> Here I heard for the first time of <persName type="diety">Jesus</persName> readiness to receive the
						poorest and most miserable sinners which proved to me, a word worthy of
						acceptation. After the meeting I went to my lodgings and cast myself at the
						feet of the friend of sinners, entrea ting Him with <name type="emotion">many tears</name> to have mercy
						upon me, and to assure me of my being accepted of him by delivering me from
						the dominions of sin in soul and body which had been on for some time a most
						grievous burthen to me. He caused me to look in <note type="catchword"

					<p> that moment believingly to Him, in a manner as I had never been able to do,
						and I felt that sin had been laimed maimed and lost its force. Declining the
						proposal of my Father, to return home and to accept of a living, he
						withdrew his asistance, which on the one hand obliged me to find my support
						by teaching frensh but set me on the other hand at liberty from accepting my
						father&apos;s proposal con trary to the dictates of my heart. <persName>Christian <add
							place="above">Renatus de</add> Zinzendorf</persName> coming in the year <date when-iso="1737">1737</date> under
						the care of <persName>John Nitchman</persName>, to <placeName>Jena</placeName>, I had the pleasure <name occupation="teacher">to be his teacher in
						music and the frensh language</name>. About easter the same year the late ordinar
						travelling through <persName>Jena</persName>, he had an enteview with all those who were employed
						to teach his son, and asked every one, after he had first spoke with each of
						us separately: Wether we were willing to devote ourselves <note

						I ought to devote myself to our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>, and to be converted to him with my
						whole heart, for not doing it will render me an unfortunate man. But to be
						devoted to the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> I do not understand.&quot; He replied: &quot;It
						is very well, this matter is only for such as understand it, meanwhile you
						may continue to instruct my son&quot;. In <date when-iso="1737-06">June of the same year</date> our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>
						was pleased to convince me, in a most striking manner of my call of to the
						brethren&apos;s church, which time I never shall forget. Till now I thought

					<p> see or attend to our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>&apos;s views with me. Previous to my going to
						<roleName>doctor</roleName> <persName>Hamburgers</persName> lectures upon natural philosophy, I meditated about myself
						and prayed to our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>, who was pleased to speak to my heart and to lead
						me into a serious consideration concerning my past and future course. The
						following questions were brought home to my heart: &quot;What will become of
						you at last and in what manner will your studies terminate? You can&apos;t
						stay always at the university. If you become a <name occupation="minister">minister</name> in your native
						country what benefit will it be of to you on others; for if you go without
						being sent by me, you will be an unprofitable servant, and it may terminate
						with you as with other awakened students who did not prosper.&quot; It you
						will save your soul take refuge to the <orgName>brethrens congregation</orgName>&quot; &amp;c.
						These and <note type="catchword">other</note>
					</p>
					<p> others considerations came with such clearness into my heart as if our
						<persName type="diety">Saviour</persName> was pre sent and speaking to me, and I was enabled to acquiesce and
						say amen to all, with my whole heart. Now I knew what I was about, heard and
						saw every thing in another light, and my eye being single the whole body was
						light, so that I could not help wondering at the change wrought in me. I
						moved with the consent of <persName>John Nitchman</persName> in the <date when-iso="1737-07">month of July</date> into the <add
							place="above">house</add> of of the young count, and which was
						exceedingly happy in the company of the brethren. <persName>John Nitchman</persName> was betrued
						and respected as a father among us, and cared for the good of our souls with
						much love and faithfulness. Our main view was to become like little
						children, and such a spirit of love and zeal prevailed among us, that we sat
						many a night <note type="catchword">till</note>

					<p> state of our souls and singing praises to him, who had chosen us from before
						the foundation of the world, and called us from among the confusion of the
						learned world to his people, and to whom we now wished to devote ourselves,
						with heart felt joy as living sacrifices. In the <date when-iso="1733">year 1733</date> we went with the
						<persName ana="John Nitchma">young count</persName> to <placeName>Berlin</placeName> where his father resided, having about 70 pilgrims
						with him. This was a blessed time for me. The singing of the brethren and
						Sisters and the discourses of the late ordinary were attended with unction
						and the demons tration of the spirit of <persName type="diety">God</persName>. <date when-iso="1733-2-08">Feb<hi rend="superscript"

					<p> was laid in my heart, and I was delivered from sin. But being ignorant of
						the previledges our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>&apos;s patients are intitled to, I perplexed
						myself often at feeling my innate depravity and did not know how to look
						upon it. But now it pleased the friend of my soul to remove this by granting
						me the favor to cast a believing look upon Him as my all sufficient
						<persName type="diety">Saviour</persName>; for being at the comn Liturgy in deep and grateful meditation
						concerning the great favor I had enjoyed in eating and drinking the flesh
						and blood of the son of man sacramentally, and sighing to him, to make me
						quite happy; he appeared in<add place="above">such</add> a most striking
						manner to my heart as my bleeding and suffering <persName type="diety">Redeemer</persName>, that I melted into
						tears like wax before the fire. From that time I proceeded from grace to

					<p> love had captivated my heart became daily more confident, and my gracious

						where the testimony of <persName type="diety">Jesu&apos;s</persName> Blood approved itself as the power of <persName type="diety">God</persName>
						to salvation upon many students and others. In the year <date when-iso="1739">1739</date> we were called

						you, whilst I was at sea. He has ordered me to mention to you in his name,
						that you are to go to <placeName>Pensylvania</placeName> to preach the gospel in the whole

						there he&apos;ll perhaps meet with books wrote against us, or hear many bad

					<p> went to <placeName ref="#mlpla000001">Herrnhut</placeName>, where I was much struck with the primitive simplicity of
						the place and the singing of all the single brethren who were just going in
						procession through the place when I arrived. Having enjoyed many blessings
						during my abode there I returned to <placeName ref="#mlpla000057">Marrienborn</placeName>, where every thing relative

							<date when-iso="1739-09-23">Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></date> I

						no ship was to sail <add place="above">to <placeName>Pensylvania</placeName></add>till the middle
						of Jany I endeavoured to spend my time as useful as I could, and kept

					</p>
					<p> brethren and Sisters. I kept meetings in the Latin language, having some
						body who inter pacted what I said into english, till I after sometime
						ventured to deliver discourses in the E. language. There was at that time a
						Society at <placeName ref="#mlpla000004">Fetterlane</placeName> which was begun by <roleName en="brother">b<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>.
						<persName>Peter Boehler</persName> and was then cared for by the <roleName en="revrend">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></roleName>
						<persName>John</persName> &amp; <persName>charles Wesly</persName>. As these people did not rightly know what they
						were at they were come into a strange fanatical way, so that I did not know
						what to think when I came for the first time into their meetings and heard
						them sigh grown and howl in a very strange manner, which they called the
						demonstration of the spirit and the power of <persName type="diety">God</persName>. at speaking with the individuals
						of this society, I found many deeply concerned for their souls. As
						deficient as I was in expressing myself in the E. Language, they pressed me

						was quartered, we had a narrow escape of being killed, being nearly trodden
						under foot, by the horsemen who came from both sides upon us when we were
						just under the gate. In the critical moment, when nothing seemed to offer
						for our relief, I espied a little space between the horses, and snatching my
						wife into my arms I slipped through, wondering at and thanking our <persName type="diety">Lord</persName> for
						his kind protection. <date when-iso="1743-11-13">Nov 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> I settled the in

						after some time it was broke up again, as we met with opposition in
						<placeName>Switzerland</placeName> and were even forbid to reside any more at <placeName>Geneva</placeName>. We now
						returned again in <date when-iso="1745-07">July 1745</date> to <placeName ref="#mlpla000057">Marienborn</placeName>. In about the time of a year we

						also with revising the hymns I had translated sometime ago and adding more
						hymns to them, which labour proved a refreshment to my heart. As
						circumstances required again our removal from <placeName>Montmirail</placeName>, we met in the
						hall for the last time to thank our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName> for all the grace he had given
						us to enjoy in this place. I arrived at <placeName>Herrnhaag</placeName> (in company of the frensh
