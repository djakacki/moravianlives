					<p> Life of brother Philip Henry Mol ther who departed at Bedford Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 9. 1780. extracted from his own manuscripts. I was born in the year 1714 Dec the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at Imsheim in the vicinity of Bussweiler in Elsa tia where my father was the parish minister. Being 8 years old, I was sent to the school at Bussweiler with a view to lay the first foundation for studying divinity. I felt already in my infancy that the friend and Redeemer of my soul was drawing me by his grace. Tho&apos; I had many bad examples before me, I remained in inocent simplicity till in my 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, when I was seduced into sin by one of my school fellows. Sin begat death, and my conscienc was repeatedly alarmed with this dreadful sentence: &quot;Thou art doomed to death&quot;, which caused me to feel unceasing anxiety of heart, &amp; imbittered the sinful pleasures of life to me, <note type="catchword">serving</note>

					<p> serving, through the kind care of the lover of my soul, as a barrier, which prevented me from rushing into misery. In the year 1734 I was sent by my parents to Metz in France in order to learn the french langua Our Saviour pursued me also here by his Grace in many ways. Being once in company with my french master, I accom panied him at night to his lodgings seeming ly in good health. The next morning I was thunderstruck at hearing that he was dead, as my conscience forced immediatly this question upon me: what would have be come of you if this had been your case? I hastened to my room trembling, and throwing myself on the ground, and prayed to an unknown God for Grace and conver sion of heart from sin. But sometime after I fell again into a dilatory track. In the year 1735 I went to the university <note type="catchword">at</note>
					</p>

					<p> at Jena, on which occasion I prayed to God with a concerned heart to preserve me from seduction and convert me. This prayer I repeated very often as I knew how hurtful bad the time was spent by the major part of the students, being afraid of falling into the same trade Soon after my arrival the late brother Daer baum went with me to the meetings of edification, held by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brumhards Here I heard for the first time of Jesus readiness to receive the poorest and most miserable sinners which proved to me, a word worthy of acceptation. After the meeting I went to my lodgings and cast myself at the feet of the friend of sinners, entrea ting Him with many tears to have mercy upon me, and to assure me of my being accepted of him by delivering me from the dominions of sin in soul and body which had been on for some time a most grievous burthen to me. He caused me to look in <note type="catchword">that</note>

					<p> that moment believingly to Him, in a manner as I had never been able to do, and I felt that sin had been laimed maimed and lost its force. Declining the propo sal of my Father, to return home and to accept of a living, he withdrew his asistance, which on the one hand obliged me to find my support by teaching frensh but set me on the other hand at liberty from accepting my father&apos;s proposal con trary to the dictates of my heart. Christian <add place="above">Renatus de</add> Zinzendorf coming in the year 1737 under the care of John Nitchman, to Jena, I had the pleasure to be his teacher in music and the frensh language. About easter the same year the late ordinar travelling through Jena, he had an enteview with all those who were employed to teach his son, and asked every one, after he had first spoke with each of us separately: Wether we were willing to devote ourselves <note type="catchword">to</note>
					</p>
					<p> to our Saviour and the Congregation, and <add place="above">were</add>desirous to be prepared for serving our Saviour Every one said yes. But the question being put to me, I answered: &quot;I am convinced that I ought to devote myself to our Saviour, and to be converted to him with my whole heart, for not doing it will render me an unfortunate man. But to be devoted to the Congregation I do not understand.&quot; He replied: &quot;It is very well, this matter is only for such as understand it, meanwhile you may continue to instruct my son&quot;. In June of the same year our Saviour was pleased to convince me, in a most striking manner of my call of to the brethren&apos;s church, which time I never shall forget. Till now I thought as is common in my circumstances, that I was bound in duty to serve my native country, which had prevented me from to <note type="catchword">see</note>

					<p> see or attend to our Saviour&apos;s views with me. Previous to my going to doctor Hamburgers lectures upon natural philosophy, I meditated about myself and prayed to our Saviour, who was pleased to speak to my heart and to lead me into a serious consideration concerning my past and future course. The following questions were brought home to my heart: &quot;What will become of you at last and in what manner will your studies terminate? You can&apos;t stay always at the university. If you become a minister in your native country what benefit will it be of to you on others; for if you go without being sent by me, you will be an unprofitable servant, and it may terminate with you as with other awa- kened students who did not prosper.&quot; It you will save your soul take refuge to the brethrens congregation&quot; &amp;c. These and <note type="catchword">other</note>
					</p>
					<p> others considerations came with such clearness into my heart as if our Saviour was pre sent and speaking to me, and I was en abled to acquiesce and say amen to all, with my whole heart. Now I knew what I was about, heard and saw every thing in another light, and my eye being single the whole body was light, so that I could not help wondering at the change wrought in me. I moved with the consent of John Nitchman in the month of July into the <add place="above">house</add> of of the young count, and which was exceedingly happy in the company of the brethren. John Nitchman was betrued and respected as a father among us, and cared for the good of our souls with much love and faithfulness. Our main view was to become like little children, and such a spirit of love and zeal prevailed among us, that we sat many a night <note type="catchword">till</note>

					<p> state of our souls and singing praises to him, who had chosen us from before the foundation of the world, and called us from among the confusion of the learned world to his people, and to whom we now wished to devote ourselves, with heart felt joy as living sacrifices. In the year 1733 we went with the young count to Berlin where his father resided, having about 70 pil grims with him. This was a blessed time for me. The singing of the brethren and Sisters and the discourses of the late ordinary were attended with unction and the demons tration of the spirit of God. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I was received into the cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I was admitted to the Lord&apos;s supper. Tho our lord had givin given me striking proofs of his Grace, I was yet subject to many changes. This true foundation <note type="catchword">was</note>
					</p>
					<p> was laid in my heart, and I was delivered from sin. But being ignorant of the previ ledges our Saviour&apos;s patients are intitled to, I perplexed myself often at feeling my innate depravity and did not know how to look upon it. But now it pleased the friend of my soul to remove this by gran ting me the favor to cast a believing look upon Him as my all sufficient Saviour; for being at the comn Liturgy in deep and grate ful meditation concerning the great favor I had enjoyed in eating and drinking the flesh and blood of the son of man sacramentally, and sighing to him, to make me quite happy; he appeared in<add place="above">such</add> a most striking manner to my heart as my bleeding and suffering Redeemer, that I melted into tears like wax before the fire. From that time I proceeded from grace to grace and the connexion with Him any beloved Lord whose <note type="catchword">love</note>

					<p> love had captivated my heart became daily more confident, and my gracious call<add place="above">of Grace</add> to belong to the congn more impor tant and precious. Having stayed 5 months at Berlin we returned to Jena where the testimony of Jesu&apos;s Blood approved itself as the power of God to salvation upon many students and others. In the year 1739 we were called to Wetteravia, which proved a means to bring me to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Marien born. July the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> the late Ordinary arrived from S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Thomas in the Westindies. As soon as he had saluted me he said: &quot;My brother I have spoken to our Saviour concerning you, whilst I was at sea. He has ordered me to mention to you in his name, that you are to go to Pensylvania to preach the gospel in the whole country.&quot; I replied: "Here I am may he do with me what is wellpleasing to him.&quot; Soon after I was ordai <note

Short- ly before my setting out on my intended post, he put me to a very severe but blessed trial by saying <add place="above">before all present</add> &quot;Our brother Molter is now going to Pensylvania, there he&apos;ll perhaps meet with books wrote against us, or hear many bad things concerning the congregation which will confuse his mind and then he will go from us&quot; &amp; I answered: &quot;I can not boast of myself and make fair pro misses; but <del>one thing</del>><add place="above">this</add> I can assertain, that before I prove unfaithful to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I must first loose sight, and entirely for get our Saviour, nothing else can seperate me from the congregation&quot;, At this declara tion I could not refrain from tears. my answer removed his thoughtfulness concer

					<p> went to Herrnhut, where I was much struck with the primitive simplicity of the place and the singing of all the single brethren who were just going in procession through the place when I arrived. Having enjoy ed many blessings during my abode there I returned to Marrienborn, where every thing relative to my future plan was settled and I was married to Johanna de Seydewir on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. As circumstances required my setting out without her, she it was resolved that she should follow me, with the next company that was to go to America. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I sat out and arrived at London Oct. the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. As no ship was to sail <add place="above">to Pensylvania</add>till the middle of Jany I endeavoured to spend my time as useful as I could, and kept meetings to a member of Germans who had been awakened by means of the testimony of
						brother Richter, who <del>was</del><add place="above">had</add> de parted this life at Algier. to the english <note type="catchword">brethren</note>
					</p>
					<p> brethren and Sisters. I kept meetings in the Latin language, having some body who inter pacted what I said into english, till I after sometime ventured to deliver discour ses in the E. language. There was at that time a Society at Fetterlane which was begun by b<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Peter Boehler and was then cared for by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> John &amp; charles Wesly. As these people did not rightly know what they were at they were come into a strange fanatical way, so that I did not know what to think when I came for the first time into their mee tings and heard them sigh grown and howl in a very strange manner, which they cal led the demonstration of the spirit and the power of God. at speaking with the indi viduals of this society, I found many deeply concerned for their souls. As deficient as I was in expressing myself in the E. Language, they pressed me so <note type="catchword">hard.</note>

					<p> Seeing that he could not obtain his aim he declined all further fellowship with the Society, and <del>stood</del>
						<add place="above">rising</add>from his seat with He walked out with the words: &quot;To me, all that are the Lord&apos;s&quot;. Some few followed him. Some brethren <add place="above">who</add> gave me an account of what had happened, I advised to be still, and to leave the isue to our Saviour. In August, I had the joy to welcome my wife here in London, on her way to America. It was left to me to let her proceed or keep her with me; but being convinced in my heart that it was the will of our Lord that she should go thither, and finding her willing to go, I accom panied her on board, where we prostrated in prayer before our Saviour and cove nanted with each other to be and remain his, after which we took an affectionate leave. In September I was recalled <note type="catchword">from</note>
					</p>
					<p> from London to Marrienborn, where having stayed for some time, I was commissioned to travel into france in order to look for such as were awakened. In Paris I found some godly persons who were mysticks and valued the writings of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Boerignor and Mrs <add place="above">Lady</add> de Guion. I also learned that there were a great many more of the same people who did not venture to make them selves known. From thence I went to Lyon Geneve by way of Lyon, here I stayed with the late Ordinary till May and enjoyed many blessings. On my road from thence to Holland I fell sick, which necessitated me to stay 10 weeks with my mother. I had no patience to wait till I was recovered, and before I reached Holland the fever had left me. In Septr I arrived at London, full of hopes and joy to pursue my destina tion to Pensylvania, but I was again seized <note type="catchword">with</note>

					<p> with another illness, so that my fellow travel lers entered upon their voyage without me.  Tho&apos; it did not appear as if I should recover, I was informed by a letter that in case of my recovering I was to go against to Geneva to serve the awakened souls in that place. After 9 weeks illness I sat out for Geneva, where I <add place="above">arrived</add> after an agreeable stay of some days at Marien born, in Feb of the year 1742. I had not been there above a fortnight when I was ordered by the magistrates, who were dissatisfied with my stay there, to quit my private lodgings, and to move to an inn. Taking a journey in the coun try I fell sick again &amp; was received and treated as a servant of Christ at the house of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Elie Prendhomme, to whom I was  recommended by his brother. It proved a great joy to me to see afterwards him and  <note type="catchword">his</note>
					</p>
					<p> his whole family, to whom I was is much  indebted, to become children of God our Saviour. This was also the <add place="above">case</add>with the family of old father Pindent, who at another time served me in the same kind manner. About this time I ventured, in reliance upon the help of our Lord, to translate our Hymns into the frensh language and in about a years time I got 70 of them printed. In April 1743 I returned to Marienborn, where I  found my wife, who was arrived from Ame rica a few days before me. I received her as if she was given me quite anew by our Saviour. After some time we travelled toge ther to the Synod, which was held at Hirsch berg. there we were appointed to visit the awakened souls in Switzerland. This jour ney proved very agreeable to us both. When we were tired of walking we sat down in a lonely spot and sung a verse, feeling excee <note type="catchword">dingly</note>

					<p> dingly well thereat. In a town called Speyer where the whole frensh armee was quartered, we had a narrow escape of being killed, being nearly trodden under foot, by the horsemen who came from both sides upon us when we were just under the gate. In the critical moment, when nothing seemed to offer for our relief, I espied a little space between the horses, and snatching my wife into my arms I slipped through, wondering at and thanking our Lord for his kind protection. Nov 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I settled the in habitants of Montmirail-house into a cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> but after some time it was broke up again, as we met with opposition in Switzerland and were even forbid to reside any more at Geneva. We now returned again in July 1745 to Marienborn. In about the time of a year we went again into Switzerland, and <add place="above">where besides my former office</add> I had also to care for the housekeeping, besides <note type="catchword"
							>this</note>
					</p>
					<p> this and the journies into the country I was employed in translating the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> accounts into the frensh language, as also with revi sing the hymns I had translated sometime ago and adding more hymns to them, which labour proved a refreshment to my heart. As circumstances required again our remo val from Montmirail, we met in the hall for the last time to thank our Saviour for all the grace he had given us to enjoy in this place. I arrived at Herrnhaag (in company of the frensh brethren and Sisters from Montmirail) in the last days of sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> of the year 1748. My stay here was not agreeable to me, as I did not like the then course of that cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I therefore kept retired and in stillness. These circumstances caused me to search my own heart thoroughly, the conclusion of which was, that our Lord was plea sed to give me a renewed impression of my <note type="catchword">election</note>

					<p> election of grace. In 1749 we were in Holland and England with the late ordinary, in whose house we spent the time very blessedly In 1750 we went to Barby, in hopes that the frensh brethren and sisters who were obliged to emigrate with the rest of the b<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and s<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> from Herrnhaag, would find it prac ticable to settle there. Meanwhile the Count of Neuwied altered to receive them in his Dominions and to grant them liberty of conscience. The late Ordinary having had an interview with the count of Neu wied, previous to his arival at Barby, he acquainted me, that he had found a place for the frensh b<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; s<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and viz: Neuwied, and told me to prepare for my journey thither. In sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I went to Herrnhaag and from thence with some of the frensh brethren and sisters to Neuwied, where we arrived Oct the 16<hi rend="superscript"

					<p> der of them <del>frensh</del> brethren &amp; Sisters arrived with us, after which we all partook of the holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at which our Saviours grace was power ful among us. We lived at first together in one house as one family. Love, simplicity, and grace and truth ruled among us, and He who regardeth the ready and poor, walked in our midst and the peace of God rested upon this cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. What trials of faith and patience we had to experience during the first 4 years is only known to our Saviour, but his faithfulness and support was our only dependence. These trials were the conse quence of our moving to Neuwied before matters had been finally settled with the count of Neuwied, for a deportation which treated afterwards with him in behalf of the unity returned after a stay of 3 weeks without being able to conclude upon anything, and we were left upon a very uncertain lasting <note type="catchword">mean-</note>

					<p> meanwhile occurred the wellknown hard trials in England, so that the brethren had no time to think of our settling here upon a sure footing, and upon all the letters we wrote during the space of 18 months, we received no answer All the newspapers were filled with the most bitter speeches against us, which were often repeated at our windows by persons who were evil inclined. We laid our heavy cir cumstances before our Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> who formed the unanimous resolution to hold our with cou rage and patience as long as possible. In the spring of 1753 the late ordinary sent a letter to the count of Neuwied importing, that his present circumstances made it im practicable for him, to assist the establish ment of a frensh Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Neuwied, and <del>that</del>
						<add place="above">the</add> people who had moved thither with that intent would probably be obliged to return to Switzerland. The Count expressed <note type="catchword">his</note>
					</p>
					<p> his compassion <add place="above">for</add><del>with</del> us and encouraged us by saying: &quot;God can still give this matter a favourable turn and bring it to bear.&quot; In Nov. It was resolved in a Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Council to send a deputy to London, who was to procure a final resolution wether we were to stay here or to move away; but our deputy falling very ill at Teist we were obliged to be patient. In July 1754 we received the long wished for message, wich put an end to all our <add place="above">concern</add> that the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was to stay at Neuwied, to build proper habitations and was to be augmented. The word of the day when I received this account form London (viz. July the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>) was: &quot;The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall ice it together: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.&quot; It is not possible to describe what joy this account occassioned in
