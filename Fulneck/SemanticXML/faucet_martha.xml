					<hi rend="underline">The Course of Life of Martha Fawset</hi>
					Martha Fawset was born in Wike in the year 1751
					May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and Baptized June y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at Scholes by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Latrobe
					She was a Child that from her earlist years took great delight in learning
					Verses and this was one great reason why she had such pleasure in
					going to the Childrens School which was at that time kept by Sister
					Betty Holdaworth she had a perticular love for her insomuch that when
					the Sister went away it cost her many Tears, in the time of her going to
					School the had two Fitts, but grow better, in the year 1763 March
					the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she was taken into the great Girls Choir which was a new
					School to her she was of a very lively dispossion which when she
					began to feel a little of her self she was some times concernd about
					it and one night in perticular she wept to her Mother and
					said she wish&apos;d it cou&apos;d be made possable for her to go and live
					some were among the Sisters, her Mother comforted her telling her it
					wou&apos;d be made possible and that she shou&apos;d only give her Heart to
					our Saviour and she wou&apos;d take care about that, and thus for the 
					present she was made satisfy&apos;d, the first time after that she
					came to Fulneck she desird her Labrous to give her leave to go 
					and live at the little Oeconomy with the Sister Mary Wight 
					<add place="above">soon after</add> she was rejoiced with the News that she had
					now leave to go and live with them Sisters where upon she went
					with great Satisfaction Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 30 1765 and became soon satis
					fy&apos;d and quite at home and was very chearfull among the Sisters
					there tho&apos; her uncommon lively turn some times occasiond the Sisters 
					to reprove her yet not with standing it was very perceptable that 
					that she had some times very serious reflections, one time in 
					perticular as the sisters was conversing together in aband like way
					she put the question to them if they thought that the Angels had
					the same share in our Saviours redemtion as the human

					Creature had, and when they answerd her that he did not dye
					for the Angels for they was not fallen as we was for they was
					no sinners, and when they repeated that verse.</p>
					<p>
					Glory be unto that heart so bloody that I poor and sinfull
					thing, Not adapted to an Angles body But a human with its
					Sting Go on smelling tasting feeling gaping ye she was almost
					as in an Extasy, some time after it was percievd that she began
					to be more thought full and woud say do let us give our Selves
					entirely up to our Saviour and then we shall all be happy
					and she began to have great pleasure in going to her bands
					and clases and all her ohoer opertunitys which otherway she
					according to her own declareation us&apos;d to have a little fear for
					because she found that with all she still got not such an
					intire heart as our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and her Labroures cou&apos;d have wish&apos;d
					her, but in this respect she became quite alter&apos;d for she hard
					ly coud wait the time when she was to go to her choir meeting
					at Fulneck and many time as she returnd home with the Sisters
					she us&apos;d to say O I wish I coud always feel as I do on those days
					I always think that I will give every thing to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but 
					yet my lightmindedness comes again but yet for all that 
					I know I am our Saviours and he will accept me just so as
					I am the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March being Congregation day in Fulneck
					she with the rest of the Sisters went to the same and got such
					an impression there from that she never lost and when it
					was given out that the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> would soon recive the Acts of the 
					Son of Man she not have a right undersanding what was said
					she understood that our Saviour was soon to come which put 
					her in such uncommon joy that she hadly knew how to contain

					her self and simply told her thoughts to the Sisters and how she
					felt about it soon after she begun to complain that she felt
					such but did not think that her dessolution was so near but
					she grew worse and worse that we at last coud think no other
					ways then that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> woud soon take her to him self her
					disorder began to grow very strong on her tho&apos; as long as she
					was able she she did not keep her bed she was often heard
					speaking when alone with our Saviour and tho&apos; she her
					self did not think that he woud <add place="above">so</add> soon take her to himself
					yet she was heard some time saying to him thy will be done
					she at last began to grow very weak but to the very last 
					she never kept her bed the day before her desolution it was
					perceptable that she woud not continue long the Sister that
					waited on her ask&apos;d her if she felt our Saviour near her
					and if she did not think that <add place="above">he would soo fetch her</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">she soon go to him</hi> to which
					she answerd that she desird him often to let her feel his 
					nearness and that if it pleasd him to take her to him self
					that he woud not delay the time too long the Morning after 
					she desird that her Labrous might be fetch&apos;d and as the Sister
					who waited on her was going to call one of the Sisters to her
					she heard her speak to our Saviour but coud not tell any thing
					she said when she came to her she percievd she was departing
					and to our great suprise she got her last kiss and thus was 
					her joy now compleated in him whom she so desird having liv&apos;d
					in this dying life 15 years 99 Weeks
