2. The Widow <persname>Christine Eleonore Seidel</persname>.
(her Maiden Name was Peistel)
She <sic>wrot</sic>  <corr>wrote</corr> of herself:
I am born the <date>28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May 1707</date> at <placename>Litowiz</placename> in
<placename>Misonie</placename>. Myn Vater has been <persname>Carl Fridric Peistel</persname>
and my Mother <persname>Eleonore</persname> born of <placename>Bradenstein</placename>,
of the generation Zoeshen by Merseburg. We have
been 5 <del rend="strikethrough">Brethren & Sisters</del>Children, two of them 
are gone home in their tender Ages, and we three
have been brought up at home, and <add>we</add> came according
to our Pradestination to the Congregation.
We had a Lovefull but a serious Mother,
who had our true best at Heart, She was a 
Lover of the Cross of Christ & <sic>aknowlegd</sic>  <corr>acknowledged</corr>
Christ crucified for her only <sic>Happeness</sic>  <corr>Happiness</corr> in time
& Eternity for every Body. She had a <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr>
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Saviour & did not Love the World, &
This has been the Subsect of <add>her</add> discoursing w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> us, in a very
evangelical Manner & this effected towards our Mother by us
a great Love & respect. By <sic>occassion</sic>  <corr>occasion</corr> She very often
declard to us: that our Saviour certified her Heart,
that not one of her Children should be lost, but all
should become his Property & live for him in this World.
This made some times a deep Impression on our Hearts,
I for my Part was not without Feeling, nevertheless I
did not know my Redeemer. In the Time following
the Lust to the World begun to stir & I <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr> to like
the World & the World liked me & seekd for me.

.10138.25708
Alone my true Saviour did't leave me Rest in
Pleasure whatsoever but transformed all wordly <sic>Plesures</sic>  <corr>Pleasures</corr>
into Bitterness, Grief & Mourning. I knew very well
I was not converted & therefore <sic>toock</sic>  <corr>took</corr> one Resolution
after the other, but without Effect; then I <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> begun
driven by the Restlessness of my Heart w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my own
Power, therefore I never found rest or get into a 
true <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Saviour. By the <unclear>infattigable</unclear>
<sic>Disire</sic>  <corr>Desire</corr> of our dear Mother our Saviour provideth for
us, and we got a Proceptor from <persname>D</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname> Buddei</persname>, Named
<persname>Hofman</persname> (a intimate Friend to our blessed <persname>B.</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname> Vierroth</persname>)
who <sic>recommented</sic>  <corr>recommended</corr> contualy <sic>continualy</sic>  <corr>continually</corr> the Love of
our crucified Saviour w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a burning Heart to
us; and was of one <sic>Opinon</sic>  <corr>Opinion</corr> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our Dear Mammy.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1735</date> our dear Saviour took our dear Mother
on a sudden but very happy home to himself.
We, her three Children where present, because our
Brother to the same time a Prussian <sic>Officir</sic>  <corr>Officer</corr> came
home by a instinct unknown for what, he found
her still well, but had not long to wait to see her
<sic>clossing</sic>  <corr>closing</corr> her Eyes happy & in Peace. Her so happy
& <sic>Joyfull</sic>  <corr>Joyful</corr> <sic>Far well</sic>  <corr>Farewell</corr>, had such a Effect on our Hearts
that we three together <sic>tock</sic>  <corr>took</corr> the resolution at once,
to have no part w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the World, but to give our
whole Hearts to our Saviour Jesus Christ.
But I for my part did't know this true Friend
of <sic>Siners</sic>  <corr>Sinners</corr>. I tried all the means I could, I read very

often the History of the Suffering & Death of our Saviour
not without Effect upon my Heart; but I <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> <sic>begun</sic>  <corr>began</corr>
by becoming Pious & to Show my Duty to God, and
so I came by all my restlessness not farther.
Then I became <sic>aquainted</sic>  <corr>acquainted</corr> with Separatists, & would
undoubtedly have fallen deeper & deeper in my own Working;
had not our Saviour directed, that <persname>Magister Seidel </persname><add>was calld</add> as
Deacon to <unclear><placename>Mutschen</placename></unclear><placename></placename> as the Place of our Residence.
He begun to preach our Saviour w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Power & Grace &
our Sav.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> regulated it so that I became his Wife, <sic>noth_
withsanding</sic>  <corr>notwithstanding</corr> all the <sic>Dificultys</sic>  <corr>Difficulties</corr> which would arise in this
respect. This Marriage was a great Blessing to my
Heart. My Husbands' tender Conversation w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> our 
Saviour moved my Heart anew, that as he ask'd me
in the first Days of our Marriage: how it would be
with me? if <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr> would drive him <add>out</add> for the <sic>Sacke</sic>  <corr>Sake</corr>
of our dear Saviour out of the Town & Country?
I made a Covenant w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> him, to follow him willingly [.]
and partake w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> him for our Saviours Sake what
would follow. A. <date>1740</date>. He went to see the Congregation
in <placename>Hhuth</placename>. This Visit brought a great Blessing about
his Heart and I got my Share by that dreams to.
From this Time quite a new a happy Period begun
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> us. A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1741</date>. The <date>22</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>d</date></hi><date> of March</date> as he was
Preaches to the Garrison at the <sic><placename>Castel</placename></sic><placename> of Königs Stone</placename>
our dear Saviour took him home in his eternal
<unclear>favoty</unclear>. He Witnesseth still on his Sick Bed towards all 

.10138.25709
who came to see him, from the Power of the Blood
of Christ with a becoming Tenderness.
His happy & <sic>Joyfull</sic>  <corr>Joyful</corr> Departure to our Saviour renewd
& fastened the Impression, I had, of the blessed Con_
versation w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> him.
Now my former Inclination to the had fixd <add>in me</add> such a
Fear of myself, that I no where trusted to live, &
imagined Danger every where; but the Friend of
my Soul soon recollected to me, that I lookd more
on my blessed Husband as on the <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr> w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> him.
This made me prostrate myself before & I begged
w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1000 Fears forgiveness over all what passed.
He Mercy took me as I was, & I had from
thence a more happy Period. By all that, I could
not get rid of my Scrupulosity by the feelings of
my Misery & like a Child draw near to him
according to my Wish, <sic>therfore</sic>  <corr>therefore</corr> the Fear of myself
darkneth my happy Hours very often. In this
very Year, I & my Sister went to see the Con_
gregation at <placename>Hhuth</placename>, there I <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> the very
Peace of God, and the Brethren & Sisters I
<sic>loockd</sic>  <corr>looked</corr> on as Children of God and had a great
respect towards them & I wishd incognito to
live in this Place. <date>1742</date>. We came to see <placename>Hhuth</placename> a
second time & there we <sic>detemind</sic>  <corr>determined</corr> to remove thither.
But by setting out for <placename>Herrnhuth</placename> some Accident
happened & we <sic>possponed</sic>  <corr>postponed</corr> our Journey. Hereby

a dangerous Period for my poor Heart begun,
a false <unclear>Poeple</unclear> filled our Minds with so much
dangerous Expectations and Things against the
Congregation, that our Journey was quite <sic>dropt</sic>  <corr>dropped</corr>.
By all that our Saviour was so <sic>gratious</sic>  <corr>gracious</corr> to
beware that I did't sin against his Church, &
my <sic>Disire</sic>  <corr>Desire</corr> still remaining to <sic>spent</sic>  <corr>spend</corr> my Days under
this <unclear>Poeple</unclear>. I was busy in reading the <sic>Deciples</sic>  <corr>Disciples</corr>
<sic>Semons</sic>  <corr>Sermons</corr> deliverd at <placename>Berlin</placename> & begged our Saviour
very often that if I belonged to this Folks, 
he would himself find means to bring me <sic>thiter</sic>  <corr>thither</corr>.
As my Brother moved from <placename>Wetteravia</placename> to <placename>Bertholsdorf</placename>,
I & my Sister paid him a Visit there for some
Weeks, by that we saw what false Opinions
had for foundation. But for all that I <sic>knowd</sic>  <corr>knew</corr>
very well that some <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr> who came to the Con_
gregation have been sent by & by back again, this
made me terribly afraid to venture asking Leave
nevertheless I <sic>feeled</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> a Instinct in my Heart
that I belonged to this People. At last I & my
Sister desireth Leave to stay in <placename>Bertholsdorf</placename>
(only to be near <placename>Hhuth</placename> & to try if we belong
to the Congregation or not) We got Leave
& then the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Jan. 1747</date>. we arrived in
<placename>Bertholsdorf</placename> to stay there.
Exact a Month <sic>past</sic>  <corr>passed</corr> as the <date>9</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Febr</date>. in a

Meeting at the Hall in <placename>Hhuth</placename> as they sung this
<sic>vers</sic>  <corr>verse</corr>: Wie bin ich doch so herzlich froh. My bloody
Redeemer on a sudden appeard before me, & my
poor Heart melted away by feeling his blessed
Nearness for Shame about my deep Misery &
Sinful Condition. I never can forget this
blessed Moment & I shall remember it & adore
my Saviour therefore in Eternity.
From this Time the Sisters took more particular
Care upon me, & for all I liveth in <placename>Berthols_
dorf</placename> I got <sic>Lieve</sic>  <corr>Leave</corr> to partake on the Communion_
Meetings in <placename>Hhuth</placename>.
<date>1747 the 22</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>d</date></hi><date> of Octob.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></date> to the greatest Joy
& Shame of my poor Heart, I was received in
the Congregation in <placename>Hhuth</placename>, this gave one a new
Spirit to lay down my whole Heart before my
Redeemer as a poor Reward for his Trouble;
and still I remember by every Reception, the 
Grace beflowed upon my <add>Soul</add> by this Opportunity.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1748 March 20</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi> I removed from Hh

to partake w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the Congregation the holy
Sacrament of his inestimable Flesh & Blood.
Here all Words fall to short to express what my
                                                                     poor

poor Heart felt thereby.
From that Time I passd my Time as well in the
Congregation as my dear Choir <sic>chearfull</sic>  <corr>cheerful</corr> and
happy and my Heart was <sic>realy</sic>  <corr>really</corr> attached to our dear
Saviour. If some times a cloudy Hour came
upon me, as whereto my poor Temper much
inclined, it was soon dispersed as soon as my
Heart <sic>weept</sic>  <corr>wept</corr> for our dear Saviours feet.
A.<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> <date>1756 the 14</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of March</date> I was taken among
the hourly Intercessors, by this special Conversation

received. the <date>8 of July</date> as the new Classes who were
errected I became a Help Mate in one of them.
The <date>3</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Febr</date>. I became the first time Choir Disciple
which was a Opportunity to keep <sic>closse</sic>  <corr>close</corr> to the Heart
of my dearest Redeemer & a true blessing for my
poor Soul (after that this Grace happened oftener to
her, and She was the last Choir Disciple.)
In the Beginning of the <date>Year 61</date>. Our dear Saviour
was very <sic>gratious</sic>  <corr>gracious</corr> to me & <sic>blest</sic>  <corr>blessed</corr> me w.<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> his Nearness
& my constant Prayer was only: Dear Saviour
remain so with me, till I see thy face to Face.
                                                                <date>18</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> Febr.</date>

The <date>16</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of Febr</date>. a.c. I had the Pleasure to move in
our new Choir-House. I desireth by that means by
our Saviour as a Present a quite happy Choir Heart.
(Since that I had lived in the House of my Brother.)
He alone knoweth the Fears of my Heart, and I know
he'll transfer me by his Mercy to his own & holy Pleasure.
So far her own Words.
That our Saviour was near to our blessed Sister in her
Choir-House & heard her <sic>Disires</sic>  <corr>Desires</corr> may <sic>easely</sic>  <corr>easily</corr> be
seen by the following verses, which she made on her
last Birth Day the <date>28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May</date>:
Wie dank ich dir mein ewger Mann
for das, was du dis Jahr gethan
an deinem armen sundgen Kind
das nichts als Mängel an sich findt.
                  X      X
Ich gebe deinen blutgen Fuss
den sünderhafsten Gruss und Kuss
for alle Gnade und Geduld
und fors vergeben meiner Schuld.
                        X    X
Ach wie beshämt es mich so sehr
Dass ich dir noch nicht mehr zur Ehr
Schenk mir ein ganz zersehmolzen Herz
verliebt in deinen Todt und Schmerz
                 X   X
Gott heilger Geist du Mutter mein
lehr mich dir recht gehorsam sein
ergiess Dich reichlich uber mich
Zum Pfingst-Fest das erwarte ich.

                  X      X
Und hofe auf ein seligs Jahr
Als sonsten noch Nie keines war.
O dass du mich so schmuktest aus,
Dass mich mein Mann nehm bald nach Houss.
                  X      X
Wie würde doch dem Würmelein
Beym Sehn des Lams zu Muthe sein
Vielleicht ben ich heut ubers Iahr
By Ihm in seiner obern Sohaar.
            X        X
Drum soll myn Aug auf nichls mehr Sehn
Als nur auf seine Leidens Schön
Dem Ohr gefalle sonst kein Klang
als nur der Passions Gesang.

It was very plain to be perceived, that the

She could herself nothing imagine more
