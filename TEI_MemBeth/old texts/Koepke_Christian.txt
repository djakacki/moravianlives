VI. The single <persname>B</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>r</persname></hi><persname>. Christian Koepke</persname>.
His own Account is as follows, viz:
I am born <date>1718 the 28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of Apr.</date> not far from <placename>Polzin
in Hinter Pomeranie in the Village of Reinfeld</placename>.
My Vater was a Tavern Keeper, & brought me up
to pray & go to <sic>Shool</sic>  <corr>School</corr>, by the <sic>Shoolmaster </sic> <corr>Schoolmaster</corr> & Minister
there; but he never was contented with me because
I was not to govern & lernt not much. In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.
Year of Age my Vater <sic>dyed</sic>  <corr>died</corr>, from this Time I begun
to try every Vice & at last came in all the Sins over
Head & Heel, & was thereby of good <sic>chear</sic>  <corr>cheer</corr>, except 
when I was alone I was afraid Gott would <sic>castise</sic> <corr>chastise </corr>
me, especially when it <sic>thunterd</sic>  <corr>thundered</corr> or hail'd.
As I was the first time to go to the Communion, I
<sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> a certain shuttering but I did't know what

[page break]

it was. My Mother put <add>me</add> out Apprentice to a <sic>Taylor</sic>  <corr>Tailor</corr>.
As <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1737.</date> my <sic>Apprenticship</sic>  <corr>Apprenticeship</corr> was expired, I <sic>travelled</sic>  <corr>traveled</corr>
to <placename>Stargard</placename>, where I the first of awakened People heard,
but did't take much Notice. In the same <add>Year</add> I went to
<placename>Stettin</placename> & there came to work by a awakened Master.
I asked my Master for <persname>Magister Schienmeier</persname>, of whom
I heard at <placename>Staregard</placename> that he tempted <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr>, I went
to hear him preach, my Master ask me how I <sic>licked</sic>  <corr>liked</corr>
<persname>M</persname><hi rend="superscript"><persname>g</persname></hi><persname>. Shienm</persname><persname>äyer's</persname> Preaching? but I did't understand
it. My Master set afterwards several time in me
& ask me Questions, as if I <sic>thinck</sic>  <corr>think</corr> myself to become 
happy by my <sic>Maner</sic>  <corr>Manner</corr> of living? I answerd boldly
My Vater <sic>dyed</sic>  <corr>died</corr> happy, why should not I.
For all that he had still Hope & by all Occasions
he said me some Thing of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. but I was so
dead <sic>licke</sic>  <corr>like</corr> a Stone & did neither feel or under-
stand what he means. But as I once went to
Bed, it was to me, as if I saw our Saviour hanging
on the Cross, I <sic>wondert</sic>  <corr>wondered</corr> at it; I opened or shut
my Eyes, it was the same. As I told it my Master
th' other Day, he mildly declared: I should take seriously
to my Mind how <sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously</corr> our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. was inclin'd
towards me, & give my Heart to him. But
I understood as little as formerly & proceedeth in
my own Way <sic>licke</sic> <corr>like</corr> before. At once I became so

.10118.25661
<sic>chearfull</sic>  <corr>cheerful</corr> & happy that I did't know what's become of
me, it was quite otherwise with me I had a blessed Time.
However this did't continue long, my Sins begun to draw
up against me, & I could not keep more to the former
all was fainted away. I begun to <sic>thinck</sic>  <corr>think</corr> I had <sic>sined</sic>  <corr>sinned</corr>
against the Holy Ghost & stood there & said: Dear
Saviour bestow Mercy upon me & forgive all my Sins!
directly my Heart was contented again. Soon after
I became acquainted w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the Brethren there, but retired
soon after, because way One of 'em <sic>offendet</sic>  <corr>offended</corr> me, & kept
to other awakened <sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr> there. <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1740.</date> I <sic>sett</sic>  <corr>set</corr> out for
<placename>Copenhagen</placename>, but before I went on Board, a Brother
advised me to keep to the Brethren at <placename>Copenhagen</placename>,
but I answerd: I had no Inclination, but says he:
run wherever you please, you never will escape our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
I thought by myself I'll take Care for the Brethren;
But scarcely I was arrived at <placename>Copenhagen</placename> I was aquainted
w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. a Brother. I kept back a long while, at last I
must go to them again, but found very little Comfort
w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> . them, because I would not obey to our Saviour.
I many Times wished, that our Saviour would let me
alone, & intented how to get rid of the Brethren, but
could't afford it, then I had a Stimulation in my
Heart to go to the <sic>Congregution</sic>  <corr>Congregation</corr>, & resisted & could't
come to a Conclusion & would't tell it because I 

.10118.25662
was afraid the Brethren would advise me to follow.
At last I took the Resolution & set <sic>of</sic>  <corr>off</corr>.
<date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1745. the 17th. of July</date> I arriv<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">d</hi></hi> at <placename>Hhaag</placename>, where it went
w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. me very well in the Begin. But afterwards as Sins
& Iniquity begun to show their Dominion again, I
was quite disturbed in my <sic>chearful</sic>  <corr>cheerful</corr> way, & thought
within myself when I but were received under the
<sic>Poeple</sic>  <corr>People</corr> of God, then it would go better; and our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
<sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously</corr> consented to my Desire & I was receivd
<date>1746 the 28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of August</date>. from thence I begun w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. more
Hope & <sic>cheafullness</sic>  <corr>cheerfulness</corr> to prosecute my Aim. Thence
I came into the Seminary as <sic>Taylor</sic>  <corr>Tailor</corr> at <placename>Lindheim</placename>,
& <date>1747 the 21</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>st</date></hi><date>. of April</date> our dear <sic>Seviour</sic>  <corr>Saviour</corr> <sic>gratiously</sic>  <corr>graciously</corr>
bestowed the Enjoyment of his holy Body & Blood
on poor me. Here I got new Strength & Grace by
his Blood to resist every that would divide me
& my Redeemer, my Heart became easy & I
<sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> the peace of God. <sic>Afterwarts</sic>  <corr>Afterwards</corr> I must often feel
my <sic>unsinerlicke</sic>  <corr>unsinnerlike</corr> & Selfish Heart, because I did't
like to appear so poorly by my Brethren as I <sic>realy</sic>  <corr>really</corr>
<sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> myself & this brought me some Times in great
Distress. <date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1748</date> I moved w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the Seminary from
<placename>Lindheim</placename> to <placename>Mborn</placename>, there I had a blessed Period,
I could disclose my whole Heart before my Saviour,
& had <sic>especialy</sic>  <corr>especially</corr> many blessing when I was <sic>excomu-</sic>  <corr>excommu-</corr>

.10118.25663
nicated by a Choir-Communion, & seekd & found the
Fault in my own Heart; & when I took myself for
not fit our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <sic>allways</sic>  <corr>always</corr> bestowed Mercy on mye & I 
got Leave to <sic>pertake</sic>  <corr>partake</corr> on his holy Sacrament.
<date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1749.</date> The Proposition if I would go to <placename>Hhuth</placename> was
offered to me, which I willingly accepted & arrived here
the <placename>30</placename><hi rend="superscript"><placename>th</placename></hi><placename>. of November</placename>. Here I had a happy Time for my
Heart, but many Schools with my Apprentices, which
caused <add>me</add> many melancholic Hour. <gap></gap> In the Year
<date>1758</date>. <add>I had</add> a new & happy Period for my Heart. I came
under they Hourly Intercessors & the holy Ghost like
a true Mother <sic>signalysed</sic>  <corr>signalized</corr> his Work this Year extra-
ordinary on my Heart, had I only been a obedient
Child! But here I remain in Debt! the <date>4</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of May</date>
I was a Acoluth receiv<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. His Nearness must me true!
<date>A</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>o</date></hi><date>. 1759</date>. I had w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. a certain <sic>Officir</sic>  <corr>Officer</corr> much Conversation
because of my <sic>Bussiness</sic>  <corr>Business</corr>, he was so rude & brutal, that
I very often <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> my <sic>naturell</sic>  <corr>natural</corr> Temper to resist, & this
gave rise to many <sic>sinnerlicke</sic>  <corr>sinnerlike</corr> Confessions before my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 
I see by all <add><unclear>mgins</unclear></add> how deep, how very deep my Heart is marred
but for all that climb on my Redeemer as the only Hope
of my <sic>intire</sic>  <corr>entire</corr> Recovery & take my Refuge to his bloody
Wounds, & there I say Lord have Mercy on me!
So far his own Words.
Every Body who <sic>knowd</sic>  <corr>knew</corr> him can <sic>attast </sic> <corr>attest</corr> that he has 
been a Heart in the <sic>Botom</sic>  <corr>Bottom</corr> of his Heart attached to our 

[page break]

Saviour & his Church. He was a true Heart in his
Choir, & <sic>knowed</sic>  <corr>knew</corr> very well that his Heart was in a 
tender <sic>Conexion</sic>  <corr>Connection</corr> w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. our Saviour, & that our Saviour
was contented w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. him; he was of a quick and hot
Temper, & <sic>eomitted</sic>  <corr>emitted</corr> by that Means a Fault in a hurry
but soon recoverd himself & sincerly beggd forgiveness
& was very <sic>Griefed</sic>  <corr>Grieved</corr> about before our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Since 
3. Year he was a blessed Labourer in his Choir. This
Year was a Year of Happiness to him, all Festivals of
the Congregation was a real Blessing for his Heart.
About his last Birth-Day the <date>28</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date>. of Apr.</date> he expressd
himself also: he formerly did <sic>belief </sic> <corr>believe</corr> there was more reason
on such Days to be ashamed as to <sic>rejoyce</sic>  <corr>rejoice</corr> so very
much; but to Day he could <sic>rejoyce</sic>  <corr>rejoice</corr> from all his
Heart, because our Saviour has been extraordinary near
to Him. <date>Last Sunday</date> as he took a Walk with a
Brother he <sic>feeld</sic>  <corr>felt</corr> himself so frosty & said: I believe 
I have a heavy Sickness to expect, & may be our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
will take me to himself; only was this Wish that
he not about <add>over</add> 4 Days must lay sick. This Wish our
Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. granted <sic>punctualy</sic>  <corr>punctually</corr> to him; Then as he th' other
was taken sick by a <sic>Pleuresie</sic>  <corr>Pleurisy</corr>, then his Presumption
took Place that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. would take him. By his
<sic>extream</sic>  <corr>extreme</corr> Pain, he was as still & patient like a Lamb.
The 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Day of his Sickness obstructed his Breast &
made the expectoration very difficult for all that
he remaineth alive & nimble according to his Disposition

.10118.25664
to the last Hour. He was very much <sic>rejoyced</sic>  <corr>rejoiced</corr> about
the pretty Feats in the Congregation on the Accensions-
<date>Day of our Saviours </date><sic><date>Accension</date></sic><date>  </date><corr><date>Ascension</date></corr><date> to Heaven</date>. And upon
inquiring: if he would not <sic>accend</sic>  <corr>ascend</corr> to Day to Heaven?
O said he: that would be a Pleasure to me!
In the following Night as the <date>13</date><hi rend="superscript"><date>th</date></hi><date> of May at one </date><sic><date>a</date></sic><date>  </date><corr><date>o'</date></corr><date> Clock</date>
he begun with a loud Voice to pray to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>: O dear
Saviour what has thou done for poor me! thyne <sic>Suffrings</sic>  <corr>Sufferings</corr>,
thine Wounds, thine Death & Punishment! O my best
most <add>dear</add> & good Heart! O how will I kiss thine feet & Hands.
O come soon! soon! Then he begun to sing: <hi rend="underline">Deime 
Marter, Angst & Stich, o Herr Jesus trösten mich!
O! <sic>myn</sic>  <corr>mein</corr> trauter Herre, gib mir nur was du ver-
<sic>dint</sic>  <corr>deint</corr> mehr ich nicht begehre</hi>!<gap></gap> O thou Lamb of 
God, have Mercy upon me! O so he continued to sing
& pray till about half a Hour before he departed.
They offered him some <sic>Medicin</sic>  <corr>Medicine</corr>, but he <sic>denyed</sic>  <corr>denied</corr> it
saying: Now I need no more, soon will I be w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
our dear Saviour! Then the 12 hourly <unclear>ratting</unclear>
begun to cease & all the Signs of his <sic>Desolution</sic>  <corr>Dissolution</corr>
appeareth. He receiv<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. the Blessing of his Choir & the
Congregation & by them Words: <hi rend="underline">Da dein Mund will er-
bleichen</hi>  he expird, in the Morning at 3 <sic>aClock</sic>   <corr>o' Clock</corr>,
& his happy Soul <sic>accended</sic>  <corr>ascended</corr> in the Arms of his
<unclear>Braudigroom</unclear> in the 46<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Year of his Age.
