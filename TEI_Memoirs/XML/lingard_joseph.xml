               <p> In <name type="event">the great Awakening</name> which happened here round about in the <date>Year 1743</date>. our Brethren and his Wife became <name type="emotion"

                  our <persName>Brethren Okerthaussen</persName> was <name type="event">put in prison</name> for our <persName>Saviors</persName>. Sake, he and some Brethren more had the <name
                     type="emotion">Happiness</name> to partake on his <name type="emotion">reproach of scorn</name> for the Gospel of Christ. The preachings were kept in his House; but as his Son
                  came of Age he became the Cause, that it must be left. Our Brother was of very few words, not talkative at all; however he <name type="emotion">loved</name> the Brethren with whom he
                  was assembled so well and dearly, that he very seldom stayed at home, notwithstanding he had above three Miles to walk; and in his <name type="health">last sickness</name> he
                  expressed himself still about? as little he sometimes understood, what he said or sung, for all that he was a praying to our <persName>Savior</persName> that he would let him partake
                  on their blessing and this was richly bestowed on him. He once met <persName>Brethren Bohler</persName> on the Road to <placeName>Brassington</placeName>, and brought him the first
                  time about this Place, whereover, he rejoiced still in this <name type="health">last Days</name>. He visited the <orgName>Congregation in Fulneck</orgName> several times and <name
                     type="emotion">felt a call in his Heart</name> to seek his abode in this <orgName>Congregation</orgName>. But this was not sooner performed while he was persuaded by his son, to
                  give over to him his whole estate, however as soon as he consented, the son pulled down his dwellinghome that he was forced as it were to seek his shelter at

                  <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>. Whereover he shortly before his End, declared himself towards his son. I lived above 80 years in this world, and have done nothing better, as my
                  going to <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>; and you never have done anymore good for me: then to pull down my Dwellings. He came hither as a stranger, with his wife and daughter with
                  a stick in his hand, without knowing where to find a place of his abode; but a brother took him to long in his house, till we could provide a lodging for him. He now was very <name
                     type="emotion">glad</name> to find for himself under the <orgName>People of God</orgName>. To be <name type="event">received into the Blessings of the Congregation</name> he must
                  stay very long, however <date>1759</date>. he was with his wife and daughter received into the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> and <date>1760</date> was <name type="event">admitted
                     to our dear Lords Supper</name>. Which he took for his highest treasure in this world. His bodily Constitution was very strong, but since 2 years <name type="health">his strength
                     decreased very remarkable</name> and he begun to pine for his eternal Rest. In his <name type="health">last sickness</name>, he was very certain that his Desire would be soon
                  fulfilled. His Patience contented Contemplations has been every Body who saw him to <name type="emotion">admiration</name>. Every Body liked to be with him and therefore rather
                  thronged them selves which Brother was to watch him. The <name type="emotion">Happyness</name> of his Heart spread itself from it so that every Stranger could perceive what our
