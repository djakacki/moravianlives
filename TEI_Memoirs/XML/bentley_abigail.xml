               <p>The course of Life of Abigal Bently 
                  I was born at Wike in the Parish of Barstel April y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1722
                  my Parrents was of the Church of England and brought me up in the 
                  same, as far as I can remember my first thought of being fared was thro'
                  hereing my Mother speak with another what time Children begun to be anser
                  -able for Sin and they thought at Seven-years, this had such an impression
                  on my mind that I often went alone and wish'd God wou'd let me die before that
                  time for then I took it for granted I should be saved, when I was about Seven
                  Years I began to be afraid of dying, my Parrents strove to preserve me as far
                  as there circumstances permitted them, in my Eleventh year I was sent to live
                  with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad things had not our 
                  dear Saviour had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul
                  and Body, when I was there they sent me into a Feild to work where I was
                  so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Fat nor could I come to any
                  House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that <hi rend="superscript">God</hi> could warm me and I grew
                  directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot God could here us <del>or know </del>
                  or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a 
                  nother <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and intended
                  to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a constant
                  condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own <del>words</del> <hi rend="superscript">writing</hi>
                  about this time she began to hear Mr Igham and when the societys of 
                  the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> was sitled <del>she</del> was me of the first of that number when the 
                  S S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oconomy was seteld at Oxhaire she after some time had
                  leave to be one of them where she continued for <del>some time</del> <hi rend="superscript">a while</hi> but her being
                  of a very League turn made it very <hi rend="superscript">heavy</hi> for her amidst of the Sisters
               </p>
            </div>

               <p>*In the year 92 Nov<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 13 she was reciev'd into the congregation
                  and as it coud not be perciev'd that she got any satisfaction in 
                  her Heart the Labours thought it more proper for her to go and
                  live with two or three Sisters who' was under the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> care which 
                  she took very much to heart and could hardly be persuaded to do as
                  was however thought for the best <del>and</del> she took it so very near that
                  it brought on a violent sickness for <hi rend="superscript">us</hi> she her self express &amp; it
                  coud never bear to be Defard of the fellowship of living in the
                  midst of Sisters, and yet at the same she was in her heart very
                  dry and her being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very heavy 
                  for her to fell as a Sinner depart alone upon our Saviour and
                  this has been ameans of her course being some what heavy in the
                  Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place
                  to place to place by the direction of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> when at last she got
                  leave to go and live with some Sisters at the Home where she
                  <del>at</del> began to feel a little more of her self and was brought
                  in to very great concern about her Salvation but as she was
                  once coming from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to 
                  her Heart, Out of pure grace unmerited, Salvation show'rs
                  on our Head Merely because the Lord had dy'd, Because a Lamb
                  was Crucify'd, Are we invited to possess a Throne, Before the 
                  World was made ordaind our own, and she was from this time made
                  sure of her Election * when the Choir House was begun at Fulneck
                  she with some others Out of the Oeconomys got leave <del>from Briard</del>
                  <del>Mortimer</del> to remove with them to that in Pudsey, but here it 
                  she did not spend her time so chearfully as could have been wish'd</p>

               <p>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro' looking so much
                  at others and being so very strict with her self she could not
                  easily look over things that some times accord amongst her compan
                  -ions, yet at the same time we cannot denigh but as to her true 
                  Heart to her Choir and the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> we was fully persuaded which 
                  show'd it self evedintly on various occasions, in the year 1754 <hi rend="superscript"><del>where in 54 she had the grace to be  </del></hi>
                  July The Diciple and Diecpless pay'd a visit to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and this
                  the earnest request of the Sister of that Ocemomey to come into
                  the Choir House at Fulneck the Diciple took it into con
                  sideration and it was made out that the said Oeconomy should
                  be entirely broken up, and so she with the rest of her Sisters
                  came here into this House where she continued very chearfull
                  for some time and cou'd not express her self enough of the joy
                  She felt that she was now got to her right home, but thro'
                  her very strict way of thinking she brought her self into <del>many</del>
                  great heavyness and deprivd her self of the Holly Communin for some
                  time she spoke with her Laboures in avery open hearted manner
                  of her whole situation and it was plain to be percevd that she
                  must be dealt with perticlar love and tenderness which her Labours
                  show'd to her at at that time and it was a great means of bringing
                  her to a clearness again in her Heart in the year 1763 complan
                  ing much of a pain in her Head she was advisd to a Cold Bath
                  which removed the pain in her Head but soon after it was percived
                  that the desorder seteld upon her Loungs and she was much
                  troubled with a voilent Cough, but in a short time grew better again
                  and it was made out that she shou'd go for some time into the </p>

                  greatest faith fullness, but thro' the desorder in her Lounge she
                  was oblig'd to be taken back again, and she her self believd that it
                  would prove a means of her disolution thus she continued in a pritty chearful
                  way and was made use of as an over seer in a Work Room and it
                  was the greatest favour to her to do any thing for her Choir and never
                  thought any thing too much but on the contrary lookd open it as the 
                  greatest grace and favour, Sep<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she had the favour to be
