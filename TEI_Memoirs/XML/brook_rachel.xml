               <p>Our late Sr Rachel Brook was  
                  born Apr. 28th 1744 at <placeName>Birstol</placeName>. 
                  Her parents, who loved the Lord 
                  directed her from her earliest 
                  years to the friend of children  
                  and took her, when a child to the 
                  Chaple at Gumersal, where she at- 
                  tended the Childrens meetings, and  
                  <del>and</del> used to be delighted to hear 
                  of our Saviours love, and when 
                  comming home she would some- 
                  time kneel down in a corner 
                  and pray to him to bless her 
                  and form her to his mind. 
                  <del>But</del> When she grew older she found 
                  that tender childlike love to our  
                  Savr growing cold, she wished to injoy 
                  the world, and its vain pleasured, 
                  but always felt a monitor within, 
                  warning her from going to broad 
                  road, which leadeth to destruction; 
                  she spent some time in great </p>

               <p>follow the Lord, and full of fear 
                  to be last eternally; during this 
                  period, which was in her 16th 
                  year, she had a very remarkable 
                  dream: it was to her as if she  
                  saw our Saviour on the Cross, in 
                  the most lovely attitude, saying 
                  to her, "all my sufferings, wounds 
                  "and bruises were for thee, to 
                  "save and redeem thy sinful soul." 
                  This made a deep impression on her 
                  mind, and she turned in earnest 
                  prayer to the Lord, that he would 
                  pardon her sins and transgressions 
                  and renew a right spirit within 
                  her, &amp; once when walking in a field 
                  by herself, with tears and prayer 
                  lifting up her hands to him, she 
                  got an assurance that her guilt 
                  should be done away, and that 
                  he would prove her good Shepherd</p>
               <p>
                  who seeks that which was lost 
                  with unwearied faithfulness. 
                  This has followed <hi rend="superscript">her</hi> all her life and  
                  often thro' grace been renewed. 
                  She now felt a desire to be closer 
                  united with the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and  
                  to injoy the priviliges of the same. 
                  Oct 4th 1760 she moved into the 
                  S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House here in Fulnek, May 11. 
                  1761 she was rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the <del>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></del> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> 
                  and May 8th the following year 
                  partook for the first time of 
                  the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She often spoke 
                  with great pleasure, of the time 
                  of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how happy 
                  she was in communion with our 
                  Saviour, and how comfortable the 
                  S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were together in the so called 
                  spinning days, and how they delighted 
                  midst great poverty in singing the 
                  praises of the Lord. - She was 
                  soon impolyed in serving as an Over-

               <p>seer with the girls, and afterwards 
                  with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted  
                  atcoluth, and for 18 years she held 
                  the Office of Houseservant, she  
                  showed much faithfulness in what 
                  was committed to her, and looked 
                  opon it as a favour, which 
                  made her Office a pleasant duty. 
                  <del>To her</del>. The last few years, she 
                  was not able to do as formerly 
                  but injoying the love of the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> 
                  they were willing to lend her a 
                  helping hand whenever required, 
                  particularly those S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in her room 
                  showed her much love &amp; attention. 
                  Tho' nothing very striking seemed to 
                  distinguish her course, we are sure 
                  that she lived in communion with 
                  our Saviour, and with childlike 
                  confidence and humble faith looked 
                  to him for help and support in 
                  every time of need.

                  Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1810 she called to mind that 
                  it was 50 years since she moved 
                  into this house, she expressed 
                  herself that she could not suffi- 
                  ciently thank our Saviour, for all 
                  his love and care, his longsuffering 
                  and forbearance, and for all his  
                  mercy towards her, and looked back 
                  with gratitude and amazement how 
                  he had proved her true friend<del>s</del> in 
                  all her spiritual and temporal 
                  concerns, that she had laked 
                  nothing; and she renewed her  
                  convenant to cleave to him, to  
                  trust his Shepherd care, till 
                  hope and faith shall cease, and 
                  Love prevail alone. 
                  Hitherto she had injoyed an unin- 
                  terrupted good stale of health, but 
                  now she began to feel the infir- 
                  mities of age, and for these last 3 
                  years, she was not able to attend

               <p>the meetings as she used to do, 
                  which <del>askes</del> was a great trial to her. 
                  She was however able to go about 
                  in the house, tho' at last with 
                  great difficulty, till the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 
                  of this month, when she had to  
                  be confined to the sickroom, her 
                  weakness increased rapidly; tho' 
                  she did not think that her de- 
                  parture was so near, she felt 
                  resigned to our Saviours will, 
                  saying: "My times are in his hands 
                  "I can <del>say</del> do nothing but pray 
                  "to him to receive me, a poor 
                  "and worthless sinner, in mercy, 
                  "and I am sure he will." - 
                  On the 13<del>th</del> she called ot mind the 
                  blessings she had often enjoyed on 
                  that great memorial day, and  
                  particularly what she had felt the 
                  first time, when she celebrated it 
                  55 years ago, during the singing of 
                  that verse:</p>
               <p>
                  O Church, how many hast thu yet 
                  Who do not love the Saviour? 
                  Who do not think his burden light 
                  Nor his sweet yoke a favour! 
                  O ye, who don't stand well with him, 
                  Do ye long for redemption? 
                  Now, now, is for you the right time 
                  Come all without exception. 
                  She spent the following days mostly 
                  in a slumber, and when she awoke 
                  between, <del>she</del> only complained on  
                  great weakness, she often folded 
                  her hands, as being ingaged in 
                  prayers, when the lipps no more 
                  could say; and on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it  
                  pleased the Lord to call her to  
                  himself in a gentle and happy 
                  manner. Aged 71. 6 1/2 Month. 
                  Among the saints in light; 
                  Behold our Sister seated: 
                  Her faith now lost in sight
