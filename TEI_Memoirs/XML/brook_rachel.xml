               <p>Our late Sr Rachel Brook was born Apr. 28th 1744 at Birstol.
                  Her parents, who loved the Lord directed her from her earliest
                  years to the friend of children and took her, when a child to
                  the Chaple at Gumersal, where she attended the Childrens
                  meetings, and <del>and</del> used to be delighted to hear of
                  our Saviours love, and when comming home she would some- time
                  kneel down in a corner and pray to him to bless her and form
                  her to his mind. <del>But</del> When she grew older she found
                  that tender childlike love to our Savr growing cold, she
                  wished to injoy the world, and its vain pleasured, but always
                  felt a monitor within, warning her from going to broad road,
                  which leadeth to destruction; she spent some time in great

               <p>follow the Lord, and full of fear to be last eternally; during
                  this period, which was in her 16th year, she had a very
                  remarkable dream: it was to her as if she saw our Saviour on
                  the Cross, in the most lovely attitude, saying to her,
                  &quot;all my sufferings, wounds &quot;and bruises were for
                  thee, to &quot;save and redeem thy sinful soul.&quot; This
                  made a deep impression on her mind, and she turned in earnest
                  prayer to the Lord, that he would pardon her sins and
                  transgressions and renew a right spirit within her, &amp; once
                  when walking in a field by herself, with tears and prayer
                  lifting up her hands to him, she got an assurance that her
                  guilt should be done away, and that he would prove her good
                  Shepherd</p>
               <p> who seeks that which was lost with unwearied faithfulness.
                  This has followed <hi rend="superscript">her</hi> all her life
                  and often thro' grace been renewed. She now felt a desire to
                  be closer united with the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
                     Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and to injoy the
                  priviliges of the same. Oct 4th 1760 she moved into the S<hi
                     rend="superscript">rs</hi> House here in Fulnek, May 11.
                  1761 she was rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the

                  partook for the first time of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript"
                     >n</hi>. She often spoke with great pleasure, of the time
                  of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how happy she was in
                  communion with our Saviour, and how comfortable the S<hi
                     rend="superscript">rs</hi> were together in the so called
                  spinning days, and how they delighted midst great poverty in
                  singing the praises of the Lord. - She was soon impolyed in

               <p>seer with the girls, and afterwards with Sisters. In 1790 she
                  was accepted atcoluth, and for 18 years she held the Office of
                  Houseservant, she showed much faithfulness in what was
                  committed to her, and looked opon it as a favour, which made
                  her Office a pleasant duty. <del>To her</del>. The last few
                  years, she was not able to do as formerly but injoying the
                  love of the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> they were willing
                  to lend her a helping hand whenever required, particularly
                  those S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in her room showed her
                  much love &amp; attention. Tho' nothing very striking seemed
                  to distinguish her course, we are sure that she lived in
                  communion with our Saviour, and with childlike confidence and
                  humble faith looked to him for help and support in every time
                  of need. </p>
               <p> Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1810 she called to mind
                  that it was 50 years since she moved into this house, she
                  expressed herself that she could not suffi- ciently thank our
                  Saviour, for all his love and care, his longsuffering and
                  forbearance, and for all his mercy towards her, and looked
                  back with gratitude and amazement how he had proved her true
                     friend<del>s</del> in all her spiritual and temporal
                  concerns, that she had laked nothing; and she renewed her
                  convenant to cleave to him, to trust his Shepherd care, till
                  hope and faith shall cease, and Love prevail alone. Hitherto
                  she had injoyed an unin- terrupted good stale of health, but
                  now she began to feel the infir- mities of age, and for these

               <p>the meetings as she used to do, which <del>askes</del> was a
                  great trial to her. She was however able to go about in the
                  house, tho' at last with great difficulty, till the 6<hi
                     rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month, when she had to
                  be confined to the sickroom, her weakness increased rapidly;
                  tho' she did not think that her de- parture was so near, she
                  felt resigned to our Saviours will, saying: &quot;My times are
                  in his hands &quot;I can <del>say</del> do nothing but pray
                  &quot;to him to receive me, a poor &quot;and worthless sinner,
                  in mercy, &quot;and I am sure he will.&quot; - On the
                     13<del>th</del> she called ot mind the blessings she had
                  often enjoyed on that great memorial day, and particularly
                  what she had felt the first time, when she celebrated it 55
                  years ago, during the singing of that verse:</p>
               <p> O Church, how many hast thu yet Who do not love the Saviour?
                  Who do not think his burden light Nor his sweet yoke a favour!
                  O ye, who don't stand well with him, Do ye long for
                  redemption? Now, now, is for you the right time Come all
                  without exception. She spent the following days mostly in a
                  slumber, and when she awoke between, <del>she</del> only
                  complained on great weakness, she often folded her hands, as
                  being ingaged in prayers, when the lipps no more could say;
                  and on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it pleased the
                  Lord to call her to himself in a gentle and happy manner. Aged
                  71. 6 1/2 Month. Among the saints in light; Behold our Sister
                  seated: Her faith now lost in sight Her happiness compleated:
