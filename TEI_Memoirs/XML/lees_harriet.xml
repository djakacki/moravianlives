               <p> Brief Memoir of the late <name type="emotion">happily</name> departed Sister <persName>Harriett Lees</persName>, who <name type="event">fell asleep in Jesus</name> on the <date>17th
                     of January 1842 </date>aged 30 - and was <name type="event">interred in the Burying Ground</name> adjacent to the <placeName>Chapel</placeName> of the United Brethren in
                     <placeName>Leominster</placeName>. // Our late sister was born on the <date>11th of February 1811</date> at the <placeName>Woodford cum Membris</placeName> in the county of
                     <placeName>Northampton</placeName>; she was brought up in the principles and doctrines of the established <orgName>Church of England</orgName> and by a pious mother was early
                  trained in the path of virtue, and though she <name type="event">lost her mother in early age</name>, yet the impressions she had perceived from that mother's good advice, teaching
                  her children to be punctual at <placeName>Church</placeName> and in the reading of the word of God were never forgotten, and were a source of great blessing to her where subsequently
                  the Holy Spirit led her to see herself as a poor sinner, and to flee to Christ for mercy. - Our late Sister frequently </p>

               <p> in her prayers that she might have some gracious Light thrown upon her mind, and be assured that her brother was accepted. Through the merits of a crucified and Risen Saviour. Upon
                  opening her <name type="object">Bible</name> after earnest prayer, the first text that met her eager eye was Look 3 ch 2' verse. "and the Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee
                  oh Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, rebuke thee; is not this a brand plucked out of the fire"-- From that time she never experienced the
                  slightest doubt of her brother's <name type="emotion">happiness</name>, but spoke of him ever after with the greatest satisfaction. --. <date>11th of August</date> she writes, "This
                  is dear, brother <persName>William</persName>'s birthday. last year he was well and <name type="emotion">happy</name> as ourselves, receiving our congratulations, this, he is in the
                  silent grave, but is he not also in heaven singing the praises of that Lamb who died to save all poor sinners! if so, how much <name type="emotion">happier</name> than we! Can be
                  with him here again. <name type="emotion">happy</name> should I be to join him of my dear Savior would see fit to call me".-- On the morning of the <date>14th of August</date> on her
                  hearing of her Father, Sister and friend, who went to a <placeName>neighboring village</placeName>

               <p> the evening before, being thrown out of their gig and <name type="emotion">very much hurt</name>, she remarks, "Oh what a day is this, called upon to hear of another accident, but
                  God in his great mercy has not seen fit that this should be a fatal one- He will not lay upon us more than we can bear. Oh may he have mercy upon the poor <name type="emotion"
                     >suffered</name>, my Father, sister and friend. <date>August the 17th </date>the day her surviving partner left after having been on a visit, she says, "May God he, always be,
                  with the friend of my dear brother". Her last observation she has left behind her in reference to this subject, was on the <date>23 of August</date>, when she writes, "Eight weeks
                  have elapsed since that melancholy event which deprived me of a dearest brother. Oh how rapid is the flight of time! soon will it bring me to him! <name type="emotion">happy</name>
                  then will be our meeting, since, then the <name>fear</name> of another separation can no more distant our <name type="emotion">happiness</name>. ---- From that time her treasure was
                  in heaven, and she took every opportunity of attending the preaching of the Gospel both of <placeName>church</placeName> and <placeName>Chapel</placeName>, </p>

               <p> and often explored the <name type="emotion">comfort</name> and <name type="emotion">happiness</name> she experienced in the house of God . -- Her health was <name type="health"
                     >delicate</name> and she was often subject to <name type="health">bad colds</name> attended by <name type="health">severe cough</name>. -- In the spring of <date>1837</date> she
                  had a violent <name type="health">inflammation of the lungs</name> which no doubt sowed the seeds of the <name type="health">pulmonary complaint</name> which caused her pilgrimage
                  thro’ time to be cut off in the bloom of life. --- The following summer she was advised to try the waters at <placeName>Leamington</placeName>, which were of great benifit benefit to
                  her, and she appeared, tho’ still delicate, to be likely to regain her former <name type="health">good health</name>.- On recovering from one of her <name type="health">bad attacks
                     of cold</name>, in a letter to her partner she writes, “I am fully <name type="emotion">sensible</name> that afflictions are at all times sent for our good, and may he who in
                  infinite wisdom sees fit to send them, sanctify them into us, and enable us to make a right use of them, and if they are the means of bringing us more earnestly to seek after the
                  things which belong to our everlasting </p>

               <p> peace, and draw our affections from the vanities of this world, to the joys of heaven and a Saviour's <name type="emotion">love</name>, and teach us strictly to examine our wicked
                  and deceitful hearts, best we should <name type="emotion">suffer</name> ourselves to be deceived by them, they will prove with rich blessings; for though they may weaken the casket,
                  they will refine the Jewels within, and at length we shall be enabled from the heart to say, it was good for us to be afflicted" On the <date>4th of June 1838</date> she was <name
                     type="event">joined in holy matrimony</name> to her surviving partner 13th. Br. <persName>William Lees</persName> of <placeName>Leominster</placeName>- After a residence of a few
                  months in that place, she was at her own earnest request admitted a member of the <orgName>Brn's Church</orgName>, at a communion <name type="event">Lovefeast</name> and having been
                  a regular communicant in <orgName>the Established Church</orgName>, she partook of the Holy Sacrament at the same time. - She always spoke of this as being a season of much
                  blessedness, and ever considered it a special leading of our Saviour, to bring her into a fold of which Jesus alone is acknowledged to be the chief Shepherd and Head.--- </p>

                  <date>The following May</date> when her respected Father in law <persName>Mr. Lees</persName> was called home in such an awfully sudden manner, she was generously supported and
                  enabled to speak comfort to her <name type="emotion">distressed</name> partner, leading him with much tenderness and simplicity to look forward to the hope set before us in the
                  Gospel, that if faithful to the end we should meet him in Heaven. Our marriage was blessed in the <date>following December</date> by the birth of a son - this, with the pure air of
                     <placeName>Leominster</placeName> seemed to have wrought a change for the better in her constitution but her gracious Saviour had higher intentions for her than to continue long a
                  sojournn soujourn in this vale of tears,- the next winter she was again much troubled with her <name type="health">cough</name>, and the medical attendant who was called in to see
                  her whilst suffering under <name type="health">a severe attack of cold accompanied by a distressing cough</name>, gave it as his opinion, that seeds of consumption had evidently been
                  sown, and were beginning to produce bad effects which caused ever afterwards great <name type="emotion">anxiety</name> in the minds of all her friends. </p>

                  <name type="event">The death of her sister</name>
                  <persName>Charlotte</persName> last summer, seemed to impress upon her mind the idea that it would not be long before she would be called <placeName>home</placeName>.- She <name
                     type="emotion">suffered very much</name> during the <date>last 3 months</date> of her pilgrimage thro' time, from weakness and her <name type="health">violent cough</name>, but
                  was always <name type="emotion">cheerful</name>, and never complained, but expressed her confidence that the Saviour who had hitherto supported would continue to be her strength.-
                  her married sister came to stay a few weeks with her early in <date>December</date> which was a source of <name type="emotion">great pleasure</name> to her, -her spirits and <name
                     type="emotion">cheerfulness</name> tho' on the eve of her confinement were particularly noticed by all around her. When the weather was not fit for her to go to
                     <placeName>Chapel</placeName>, and she was recommended to stay at home, her answer always was, "I am able to go, the Lord blesses any soul more than the effort injures my <name
                     type="health">feeble frame</name>", nor would she ever miss as long as she had strength to go. When her sister in law <persName>Mrs. C Lees</persName> married again <date>last
                     January</date> she understood her Tract </p>

                     type="emotion">enjoyment</name> she had in her visits among the poor, supplying them with the food of eternal life, and many gave her <name type="emotion">great pleasure</name> by
                  the thankfulness with which they received the tracts. - The last day our dear sister was permitted to attend <placeName>the Chapel</placeName>, was at <name type="event">the
                     Lovefeast on Christmas day</name>, which she enjoyed very much.- she was quite overcome when she returned <placeName>home</placeName> and said "this is the last time I shall go
                  for the present." On the <date>29th of December</date>, she was safely and most mercifully <name type="event">delivered of a second son</name>, and the strong arm of the Lord was so
                  whom her during the time of nature's trial, that she spoke of it afterwards, that had she seen her Saviour bodily present, she could not have felt his support more than she did. The
                  first few days she <name type="health">seemed to be doing remarkably well</name>, but afterwards she did not gain strength, whilst of the same time </p>

               <p> she <name type="health">lost her appetite</name>, which she attributed to a very painful affection in her and from which <name type="health">she suffered much</name>. The Surgeon
                     <name type="health">administered some medicine</name> which greatly relieved her, and her anxious friends then hoped she would go on well, but it was otherwise ordered, for on the
                  Thursday previous to her departure she was <name type="health">taken with a fainting fit</name> producing hysterics -- by the means used she soon recovered and became <name
                     type="health">comfortable</name> again, and would insist on her husband's attending <name type="event">the anniversary meeting of the Sunday schools</name> which was held that
                  evening.-The next morning her medical attendant informed her friends that she was <name type="health">suffering from severe disease on her lungs</name>, and that she was in great,
                  tho' not immediate danger, and if the disease could be kept down to allow her to gain strength she might be partially restored. When it was mentioned to her she exclaimed, "I am in
