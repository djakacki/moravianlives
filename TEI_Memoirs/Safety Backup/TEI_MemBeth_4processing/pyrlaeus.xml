            I am <add>was</add> born at <placeName>Pausa in Voetland</placeName> the <date>25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
               of Apr. 1713</date> &amp; well 3 Months after the Death

            dent as also his Father &amp; Grand-Father
             &amp; died in his 33<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year. My Mother was
             then 26 Years old, &amp; had besides me yet
             3 minor <add>younger</add> Children. She was very pious &amp; reli-
             gious, &amp; put their her  Hope &amp; Confidence on God,
             she loved her Children very tenderly, &amp; out
             of Care for them she refused all <add>Proposals of</add> Marriages
            offered to her, &amp; remained a Widow, till she left 
             this World in Confidence upon the Merits
             of Jesus <date>1764</date> in the 78<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of her Age.
             She educated us with much Love &amp; Care.
             When we had grieved her with <add>by</add> Disobedience,
             then she wept &amp; this had chastised us. She kept

            &amp; concluded with a Prayer. I had the first
            melting Impression of the Passion of Jesus
            at singing <add>once</add> these Words: O Lord let me find Grace
            &amp;c. <gap>  </gap>I must weep thereby, &amp; my Mother perceiving
            this, explained unto us the Matter of Jesus
            Christ our Mediator, who took upon himself
            all our Sins &amp; Iniquities out of inexpressible
            Love &amp; has suffered therefore the bitter Death
            on the Cross. From my 5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> Year I was sent
            in the <add>to</add> School<gap></gap> In the Year <date>1726</date> I enjoyed
            for the first time the Lords Supper, with
            an holy &amp; awful Trembling.
            About this Time I experienced a particular Re-
            servation of God. I was ringing the large Church-
            Bell with another Boy, all at once the Rope fell
            down upon my Bed <add>Head</add>, &amp; cast me down through the
            Hole two Stories upon the Stones <hi rend="superscript">so</hi> that I was brought
            home as dead. But I recovered soon. The Hurt
            which I suffered thereby was not of so long &amp; pain-
            ful Consequences as another, which I have expe-
            rienced by the Seductions of another Boy.
            Till now, I had been in a simple &amp; childlike Con-
            versation with our Savior; for when I had grieved 
            him with Lightmindedness, Disobedience or such
            
            <cb/>
            
            Things, I had no Rest, till I <add>either</add><add></add> alone or with 
            my Sister fell down before our Saviour, prayed
            for &amp; felt his Pardon. The Poison of Sin had indeed
            well been within me; but now I experienced the
            Death <add>Agony</add> &amp; Distress, which it <hi rend="superscript">causeth </hi>makes in the Heart. 
            For through I resisted <add>it</add> with all my Power, yet
            I must <add>had to</add> perceive from Time to Time its Dominion
            &amp; my Inability. Thereby I came <add>thereby</add> in an anxious 
            Situation, but sometimes experienced Comforts
            of our Savior, &amp; received the Assurance, that
            I should not be lost. In the Year <date>1728</date> I went
            to <placeName>Schlaiz</placeName> on the <add>to</add> School, where I was 5 Years
            &amp; must <add>had to</add> get my Livelihood by <add><hi rend="superscript">teaching</hi></add>  instructing Children, in 
            writing &amp; Music. My <add>outward</add> Poverty with the Fear for of
            Shame retained <add>kept</add> me from many Excesses. Other
            Men thought <add>that</add> I was religious, &amp; I must <add>had to</add> suffer many
            Mockeries from my Fellow Disciples <add>Scholars</add>, who called
            me a Pietist. In <date>June 1733</date> I went with 22
            Ryksdollars upon the <placeName>University at Lepzick <add>s</add></placeName>, 
            received a Pension of 30 Ryksdollars yearly,
            &amp; at the End of the Year free Boarding, for
            which benefit I thanked God heartily.
            In the Year <date>1735 in April</date>, a Student sitting <add>who sat</add> next
            me, dying suddenly was <add>proved</add> the Occasion, that 
            I was stirred up anew in my Heart, considering

            thereby <add>at the same time</add> the Uncertainty of the Hour of Death,
            &amp; resolvedy to watch over my <add>self </add>&amp; to be concerned
            continually about my Salvation. I longed
            to be acquainted with a Student, to whom I
            could reveal the Situation of my Heart
            but I found none to whom I could have such
            a Confidence, till in <date>June 1737</date>, when I was <add>became </add>
            acquainted with one <persName>Simmich</persName>. By <add>At</add> his first Visit
            I could lay before him my restless &amp; about
            my Salvation concerned Heart, &amp; tell him
            with what anxious Exercises &amp; Resolutions
            I had tired myself, to betrid of Sin &amp; <add>become</add> assured 
            of the Grace of God. He replied: Dear Sir,
            On this Way you will not find Rest for your
            troubled Soul. You must as a Sinner, who has
            deserved Curse &amp; Damnation come with all
            your misery come to Jesus Christ, the Saviour
            of the Sinners &amp; This Man was to me a 
            Messenger of the Grace of the Gospel, &amp; by
            him I came also into Acquaintance, with 
            the other awakened Students, who were in
            <sic>Connexion</sic> <corr>Connection</corr> together. I read now the New
            Testament a-new, &amp; was thereby powerfully
            
            <cb/>
            
            convinced of theis Truth, &amp; prayed to our Saviour,
            to reveal to me by his holy Spirit his great
            Work of Redemption. From that Time he let
            me find Grace in his Blood. In <date>Sept.</date> <persName>B</persName><hi rend="superscript"><persName>r</persName></hi><persName>.</persName>

            My open hearted Conversation with him, &amp; his
            Compassion with my vain Efforts, were blessed
            to my Heart. Returning from <placeName>I</placeName><placeName><placeName>e</placeName>na</placeName> he related

            there, which I did in <date>October</date>, &amp; was received
            with much Love. The Conversations with the

            Year <date>1738</date> had yet more Occasion, to grow
            in the Knowledge of my self &amp; of Jesus Christ.
            I had till now <add>gone</add> but once in <placeName>Lipsick</placeName> gone to 
            the Lords Supper, because I thought myself
            unworthy of it, but now I enjoyed it with

            I cannot express in Words, what Joy &amp; Amaze-
            ment I have felt in the Meetings in the
            Hall, by the Visits in the Families &amp; in the
            Conferences with the Strangers. It was al-
            ways in my Heart: Thou belongst to this Peo-
            ple, thou must be and remain here, else thou
            art in Danger of being lost. After having heard
            returned to <placeName>Lipsick</placeName>, I received in <date>Oct.</date> from
            <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName> a Call <add>to</add> be in Lauban Tutor of 
            the Children of the awakened Citizens <add>in <placeName>Lauban</placeName></add> those
            I regarded this Call as a <add>Beck</add> of our

            Our Saviour owned my Service graciously as
            well by<add> both at </add>the Information of the Children, and by <add>at</add>
            the Repetition of the Sermons every Sunday.
            I had also an agreeable Conversation <add><sic>nexion</sic></add> <corr>nection</corr> with  
            the single B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi> there, &amp; went with <add>some of </add>them on
            the Congregation Days to <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>. In <date>May
               1739</date> we went together in the Church to the
            Lords Supper. But soon afterwards a Per-
            secution commenced, the Meetings were prohi-

            I received <add>was</add> Advised to go away, which I did
            the <date>30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi> of May</date>, &amp; afterwards I heard that
            they had searched <add>for</add> me the same Night in my
            Lodging. On this Manner I went to <placeName>Herrn-
               hut</placeName>, to stay there. In <date>June</date> I was present,
            when the Corner-Store to the first House
            of the single B<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">rn</hi></hi> was laid, &amp; it was to me <add>a Pleasure to me</add>
            Joy to do in my Leisure Hours the Service <add>Work</add> of
            a Journey Daylabouring Man. Here I was informed Chil-

            soon admitted to the H. Communion.

            I saw for the first Time with Amazement

            Occasion this Place was called <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>.
            The <date>22 of Febr. 1742</date> I was ordained at the
            Synod at <add>in</add> <placeName>Oley</placeName>. On this solemn Day of Grace
            &amp; Blessing also the first 3 Indians were
            also baptized. In <date>July</date> I was married with
            <persName>Susana Bennezet</persName> from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. I was
            |Adjunctus| Assistant of the Ordinary in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
            |: he had as it is known rece accepted there 
            the Office of a Lutheran Minister :| but <add>I</add> was
            the <date>29 of July</date>, from <add>by</add> an exasperated and drunk-
            en Mob violently drawn from the Pulpit
            whereupon in the Name of the Reformed
            the Church was taken in Possession <add>of</add>. We went
            with a Part of the Congregation to our
            Lodging, where the divine Service was con-
            tinued, &amp; so we went on in this Manner, till
            a new Church was built &amp; dedicated the <date>23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>
               of Nov.</date> After the Departure of the Ordinary
            in <date>Jan. 1743</date> I with my Wife moved to <placeName>Conrad
               Weisser</placeName>, to learn from him the Language of
            the Macquai Indians &amp; to instruct his Chil-
            dren. After 3 Months we moved to the Indians
            
            <cb/>
            
            partly to profit &amp; more in their Language, &amp;
            partly to see, if Mere something <add>was</add> to be done a-
            mongst them for the Brethren <add>our Savr</add>. On a Visit
            by the Indian Congregation in <placeName>Shekomeko</placeName>
            &amp; <placeName>Pachgatgoch</placeName> <add>in <date>June</date></add> I was arrested with the <persName>Brethren
               Martin Mack &amp; Shaw</persName>, &amp; brought to<placeName> New-Mill-
                  ford in Connecticut</placeName>. The Impeachment <add>Accusation</add> was
            that we preached in strange Parishes |: The
            whole Country is namely divided in Parishes,
            &amp; the Land of the Indians being contained
            in it; it was impossible for the Brethren to
            preach the Gospel to the Indians, without
            to preach in on or other Parish :| By <add>At</add> the Trial
            we had <unclear><add>[?]</add></unclear><add></add> Opportunity oftentimes, to testify of
            our Ground of Salvation. After having been
            dismissed, I continued with my Wife our Jour-
            ney in the Land of the Macquai Indians, where
            we lived, near an Indian town in great Po-
            verty, Difficulty &amp; Danger. In <date>Sept.</date> we return-
            ed to <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName> In <date>Febr. 1744</date> I began to
            instruct some B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi>. &amp; S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></hi>. in the Language

            <date>1751</date> we were called back to Europe, from
            which Time till <date>1769</date> I served in <sic>divers</sic> <corr>diverse</corr>
            Congregations in England as Minister.
            Then we were called to <placeName>Gnadau</placeName>, made a Visit
            in <date>April</date> in <placeName>Herrnhut</placeName>, where we found an
            Employment unexpected to us. The <date>8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> of Oct. 
               1779</date> it pleased my dear Lord to place me in
            the Widowers-State, whor eat <add>about which</add> he himself has
            comforted me. Our Marriage has been blessed
            in America with 3 Children &amp; in England also
            with 3 Children. My happy Wife has had
            the Pleasure shortly before her Departure to
            see her 3 Children from England She is now
            in Peace; but i am yet in the Valley of
            Tears &amp; feel, how the mortal Body pressath
            me. But my Spirit &amp; Soul are longing for
            the Appearance of my Saviour, when he also
            
            <cb/> 
            
            will call me in <add>to</add> the eternal Rest into his
            Arm &amp; Bosom. O who shall know what is
            happening when he sees Face to Face the

            So far his own Account.
            His Choir is yet adding: We can give the
            Testimony to our late Brother, that he has gone on
            carried in our Choir <add>in</add> an happy &amp; editying
            Walk <add>Course</add>. He thought mean of himself. His Heart
            was <add>so</add> penetrated of the Love, Blood &amp; Death
            of Jesus, that by <add>upon</add> all Opportunity <add>Occasions</add>, <add>as well</add> both 
            <sic>publickly</sic> <corr>publicly</corr> and in private Conversation his
            Mouth was overflowinged of it. He loved
            heartily, served his B<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">rn</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"></hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">rs</hi></hi> where of was <add>ever he could, </add>
            possible to him, &amp; was also universally <add>be</add> loved.
            The first Years of his Widowers-State he
            served as well in the Congregation as before,
            and also in our Choir with Grace &amp; Blessing.
            But soon an old Hurt on his Head appeared <add>broke out</add>

            he could not turn his Neck, whereto came a
            Palsy on Hands &amp; Feet. In this Situation,
            when he must be nursed as a Child he was
            given resigned as a Child in <add>to</add> the Will of our
            Saviour, &amp; expected, though with longing De-
            sire, yet with Patience the Hour of his De-
            parture. The <date>25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of Apr. <add>1785</add></date> he celebrated
            with some B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi><hi rend="superscript"></hi> his Birth Day very happy
            &amp; <sic>chearful</sic> <corr>cheerful</corr>, with <add>by</add> a Love-Feast &amp; musical Song,
            wherewith his Children rejoiced him unex-
            pectedly. At the Conclusion he read the Hymn
            which was sung to the present B<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></hi> with
            an affected Heart saying: " This was to my Bu-
