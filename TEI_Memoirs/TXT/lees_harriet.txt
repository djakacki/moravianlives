 Memoir of Harriet Lees + Family. 1842 at Leominster aged 30  Brief Memoir of the late happily departed Sister Harriett Lees, who fell asleep in Jesus on the 17th                      of January 1842 aged 30 - and was interred in the Burying Ground adjacent to the Chapel of the United Brethren in                      Leominster. // Our late sister was born on the 11th of February 1811 at the Woodford cum Membris in the county of                      Northampton; she was brought up in the principles and doctrines of the established Church of England and by a pious mother was early                   trained in the path of virtue, and though she lost her mother in early age, yet the impressions she had perceived from that mother's good advice, teaching                   her children to be punctual at Church and in the reading of the word of God were never forgotten, and were a source of great blessing to her where subsequently                   the Holy Spirit led her to see herself as a poor sinner, and to flee to Christ for mercy. - Our late Sister frequently  in her prayers that she might have some gracious Light thrown upon her mind, and be assured that her brother was accepted. Through the merits of a crucified and Risen Saviour. Upon                   opening her Bible after earnest prayer, the first text that met her eager eye was Look 3 ch 2' verse. "and the Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee                   oh Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee; is not this a brand plucked out of the fire"-- From that time she never experienced the                   slightest doubt of her brother's happiness, but spoke of him ever after with the greatest satisfaction. --. 11th of August she writes, "This                   is dear, brother William's birthday. last year he was well and happy as ourselves, receiving our congratulations, this, he is in the                   silent grave, but is he not also in heaven singing the praises of that Lamb who died to save all poor sinners! if so, how much happier than we! Can be                   with him here again. happy should I be to join him of my dear Savior would see fit to call me".-- On the morning of the 14th of August on her                   hearing of her Father, Sister and friend, who went to a neighboring village the evening before, being thrown out of their gig and very much hurt, she remarks, "Oh what a day is this, called upon to hear of another accident, but                   God in his great mercy has not seen fit that this should be a fatal one- He will not lay upon us more than we can bear. Oh may he have mercy upon the poor suffered, my Father, sister and friend. August the 17th the day her surviving partner left after having been on a visit, she says, "May God he, always be,                   with the friend of my dear brother". Her last observation she has left behind her in reference to this subject, was on the 23 of August, when she writes, "Eight weeks                   have elapsed since that melancholy event which deprived me of a dearest brother. Oh how rapid is the flight of time! soon will it bring me to him! happy                   then will be our meeting, since, then the fear of another separation can no more distant our happiness. ---- From that time her treasure was                   in heaven, and she took every opportunity of attending the preaching of the Gospel both of church and Chapel,  and often explored the comfort and happiness she experienced in the house of God . -- Her health was delicate and she was often subject to bad colds attended by severe cough. -- In the spring of 1837 she                   had a violent inflammation of the lungs which no doubt sowed the seeds of the pulmonary complaint which caused her pilgrimage                   thro’ time to be cut off in the bloom of life. --- The following summer she was advised to try the waters at Leamington, which were of great benifit benefit to                   her, and she appeared, tho’ still delicate, to be likely to regain her former good health.- On recovering from one of her bad attacks                      of cold, in a letter to her partner she writes, “I am fully sensible that afflictions are at all times sent for our good, and may he who in                   infinite wisdom sees fit to send them, sanctify them into us, and enable us to make a right use of them, and if they are the means of bringing us more earnestly to seek after the                   things which belong to our everlasting  peace, and draw our affections from the vanities of this world, to the joys of heaven and a Saviour's love, and teach us strictly to examine our wicked                   and deceitful hearts, best we should suffer ourselves to be deceived by them, they will prove with rich blessings; for though they may weaken the casket,                   they will refine the Jewels within, and at length we shall be enabled from the heart to say, it was good for us to be afflicted" On the 4th of June 1838 she was joined in holy matrimony to her surviving partner 13th. Br. William Lees of Leominster- After a residence of a few                   months in that place, she was at her own earnest request admitted a member of the Brn's Church, at a communion Lovefeast and having been                   a regular communicant in the Established Church, she partook of the Holy Sacrament at the same time. - She always spoke of this as being a season of much                   blessedness, and ever considered it a special leading of our Saviour, to bring her into a fold of which Jesus alone is acknowledged to be the chief Shepherd and Head.--- The following May when her respected Father in law Mr. Lees was called home in such an awfully sudden manner, she was generously supported and                   enabled to speak comfort to her distressed partner, leading him with much tenderness and simplicity to look forward to the hope set before us in the                   Gospel, that if faithful to the end we should meet him in Heaven. Our marriage was blessed in the following December by the birth of a son - this, with the pure air of                      Leominster seemed to have wrought a change for the better in her constitution but her gracious Saviour had higher intentions for her than to continue long a                   sojournn soujourn in this vale of tears,- the next winter she was again much troubled with her cough, and the medical attendant who was called in to see                   her whilst suffering under a severe attack of cold accompanied by a distressing cough, gave it as his opinion, that seeds of consumption had evidently been                   sown, and were beginning to produce bad effects which caused ever afterwards great anxiety in the minds of all her friends. The death of her sisterCharlotte last summer, seemed to impress upon her mind the idea that it would not be long before she would be called home.- She suffered very much during the last 3 months of her pilgrimage thro' time, from weakness and her violent cough, but                   was always cheerful, and never complained, but expressed her confidence that the Saviour who had hitherto supported would continue to be her strength.-                   her married sister came to stay a few weeks with her early in December which was a source of great pleasure to her, -her spirits and cheerfulness tho' on the eve of her confinement were particularly noticed by all around her. When the weather was not fit for her to go to                      Chapel, and she was recommended to stay at home, her answer always was, "I am able to go, the Lord blesses any soul more than the effort injures my feeble frame", nor would she ever miss as long as she had strength to go. When her sister in law Mrs. C Lees married again last                      January she understood her Tract  District and missionary subscribes in the Town, and tho' often poorly, her Saviour gave her strength to do his work, and she often expressed the enjoyment she had in her visits among the poor, supplying them with the food of eternal life, and many gave her great pleasure by                   the thankfulness with which they received the tracts. - The last day our dear sister was permitted to attend the Chapel, was at the                      Lovefeast on Christmas day, which she enjoyed very much.- she was quite overcome when she returned home and said "this is the last time I shall go                   for the present." On the 29th of December, she was safely and most mercifully delivered of a second son, and the strong arm of the Lord was so                   whom her during the time of nature's trial, that she spoke of it afterwards, that had she seen her Saviour bodily present, she could not have felt his support more than she did. The                   first few days she seemed to be doing remarkably well, but afterwards she did not gain strength, whilst of the same time  she lost her appetite, which she attributed to a very painful affection in her and from which she suffered much. The Surgeon                      administered some medicine which greatly relieved her, and her anxious friends then hoped she would go on well, but it was otherwise ordered, for on the                   Thursday previous to her departure she was taken with a fainting fit producing hysterics -- by the means used she soon recovered and became comfortable again, and would insist on her husband's attending the anniversary meeting of the Sunday schools which was held that                   evening.-The next morning her medical attendant informed her friends that she was suffering from severe disease on her lungs, and that she was in great,                   tho' not immediate danger, and if the disease could be kept down to allow her to gain strength she might be partially restored. When it was mentioned to her she exclaimed, "I am in                   the Lord's hands, he has abundantly helped me, and if it is his will he will do so now, but if not, He will take me to him self tho' such a poor sinner-- Her only anxiety seemed to be, that if she got better, she should  never be able to do much for her baby, her husband and her little boy of whom she was doatingly fond. She seemed according to all appearances, to be                      gradually improving in strength, during Saturday and Sunday tho' exceedingly weak, and she enjoyed the company of her friends                   very much, especially on Sunday-- On Sunday morning, when the texts of the day read to her, she was much cheered and struck with the Doctrinal text, from Cor: 9 ch: 26, " I therefore                   so pure, not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beateth the air". "Help us to obtain the prize, "Help us well to close our race" On Monday morning, after a good night's                   rest, she took leave of her sister, who was obliged to return home, in the most cheerful manner, and her cheerfulness                   throughout that day was most remarkable, -- but who can understand the mysterious ways of the Almighty. - After taking her tea, setting up in her                      bed, which she had enjoyed very much, she fell back on her pillow, apparently in a fainting fit, - as long as she had strength, she gave directions as to the remedies to be applied, but these, and the medicines given by the                 Doctor who was instantly called in, failed of the desired effect, and in a few moments the vital spark fled with scarcely a struggle, and she was wafted by                      Angels to those heavenly mansions, prepared for her, where her Saviour had prepared for her an ever lasting crown, and she is now joining the blessed chorus above, singing,                   "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain"- Her childlike confidence in her Saviour, her mild and amiable disposition, and esteem of all who knew her, and will never be forgotten. As Wife,                   Sister, Friend and Mother, - Where was such another?- The loss to her afflicted partner and children, can only be supplied by the Gracious Father, who has taken out of this role of                   tears this his handmaiden in early life- Oh may it lead us all to place our only hopes on that firm Rock on which our happily departed Sister built, and in life and in death put over                   trust in Him, according to the hymn No 630, which she used to delight in - "When by adversity I'm tried- "In God my Rock I will confide- Midst trials what- soe'er they be- Rely on                   his fidelity.-
